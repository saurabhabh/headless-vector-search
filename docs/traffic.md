Foreword

Western Australia has over 170 000 kilometres of roads, which periodically require re-
construction, maintenance or work on services within their road reserve. With current
economic recovery efforts, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic being focused on
provision of public infrastructure, more than $8 billion of funding has been allocated to
transport projects. This will significantly increase the amount of works being conducted
on Western Australian roads. If not managed well, these tasks have the potential to
create hazardous situations for both road workers and users that may produce serious or
even fatal consequences.

Main Roads Western Australia has adopted the Safe System approach to managing the
road network and the Traffic Management for Works on Roads Code of Practice utilises
these principles. This Code provides mechanisms to protect all road users (including
road workers), acknowledging that people are fallible and have limited ability to tolerate
impact forces.

I have authority under Regulation 297 of the Road Traffic Code 2000, to erect, establish
or display, alter or take down any road sign or traffic control signal. With this comes a
duty of care to facilitate the safe and appropriate use of road signs and devices. These
requirements have been developed in conjunction with key stakeholders in recognition of
this obligation.

The requirements promote safe and consistent traffic management practice at work sites
on roads in accordance with state legislation and national standards. They require
general compliance with the Austroads Guide to Temporary Traffic Management
(AGTTM) and Australian Standard 1742.3 - 2019 , with details of additional requirements
necessary to meet Western Australian requirements and advise of departures to the
requirements of the AGTTM and Australian Standard that I am prepared to allow on
Western Australian roads. The requirements also outline the competency requirements
for personnel responsible for managing traffic on work sites and the need to hold a
qualification relevant to the specific task in traffic management.

This document, initially released in March 2004, has been prepared following extensive
consultation with local government, industry and other stakeholders through Advisory
Group meetings, Technical Committee meetings, a technical workshop and other
forums.

I encourage all persons involved in managing traffic at work sites on roads to fully
familiarise themselves with these requirements, to apply them with due consideration to
the situations that present to them and to carefully comply with the mandatory
requirements. This will result in safer work sites for yourselves, your fellow workers and
all road users.

## 1. INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE

### 1.1 INTRODUCTION

This Code of Practice (herein after referred to as the ‘Code’) describes the Main Roads Western
Australia’s (Main Roads) requirements for managing traffic at work sites on roads. It requires
traffic management for works on roads to be based on the Austroads Guide to Temporary Traffic
Management (AGTTM) and AS 1742.3– 2019 , unless otherwise specified by a requirement in
this Code. In the event that there is a conflict between this Code and AGTTM or AS 1742.3 –
2019 , the Code must take precedence.

The purpose of this Code is to specify any variations or additional requirements to AGTTM and
AS 1742.3 – 2019 which are required at works on roads in Western Australia.

The prescribed practices are the minimum requirements, on which the Traffic Management
Plans (TMPs) for all Western Australian roads must be based. Main Roads recognises that
situations sometimes arise where application of these requirements is not appropriate and that
variation to these requirements will be necessary. When it becomes apparent that deviation is
necessary from the requirements of this Code, persons arranging the works should carefully
consider all possible options, using common sense and judgment based on ‘risk management’
carried out in accordance with sections 4.3 and 4.5. Further, they must ensure that their
actions are consistent with related legislation.

See AGTTM Part 1 for more details on Temporary Traffic Management (TTM) purpose,
philosophy and principles.

Practitioners should be aware of the document titled Traffic Management for Events Code of
Practice that has been placed on Main Roads’ website - see ‘Technical and Commercial’ >
‘Working on roads’. This document has been designed to complement the Traffic Management
for Works on Roads Code of Practice in respect to the various traffic management issues that
are common to works on roads and to events, particularly in respect to the design and
implementation of Traffic Management Plans.

### 1.2 SCOPE

This Code applies to all work conducted within all road reserves throughout Western Australia
and the planning of any proposed works.

Where it appears in the Code the term ‘work’ refers to:

- construction and maintenance work in work sites wholly or partly within the road
    reserve boundaries and must apply in any situation where traffic control devices are
    used to warn, instruct and guide road users in the safe negotiation of work sites on
    roads including unsealed roads together with footpaths, shared paths, and bicycle
    paths adjacent to the roadway; or
- any other works which cause interference or obstruction to the normal use of a road by
    any road user.

This Code is applicable to traffic management for road and bridge construction and
maintenance sites, as well as works associated with other public utilities and services.

### 1.3 AUSTROADS SAFETY AT ROAD WORKSITES

#### 1.3.1 Austroads Guide to Temporary Traffic Management

The 2019 update of AS1742.3 by Standards Australia has resulted in the removal of content
from the existing standard (2009) that has been determined to be guidance material, which is
not appropriate to locate within an Australian Standard. This guidance material has now been
substantially transferred into the Austroads Guide to Temporary Traffic Management (AGTTM)
with an expansion to the guidance material based on information from Austroads member
organisations.

The Guide to Temporary Traffic Management (AGTTM) is a set of comprehensive Austroads
publications developed to provide a best practice reference for the development of safe, cost
effective and efficient Temporary Traffic Management (TTM) solutions for Australia and New
Zealand. Comprised of 10 parts, AGTTM is now freely available on the Austroads website
(www.austroads.com.au go to ‘Transport Network Operations’ > ‘Temporary Traffic
Management’).

AGTTM version 1.1 has now been adopted in Western Australia. Note: no changes were
made to AGTTM Part 8.

#### 1.3.2 Road Categories and Training

Austroads TTM Categories

A TTM categorisation system has been adopted in the AGTTM based on the New Zealand
road levels. While all works on roads are considered high risk, the categorisation into three
categories allows design practices and training to be tailored to the different risk levels at each
category.

See AGTTM Part 8 for more details.

The WA road network is yet to be categorised, unless this Code states otherwise any
recommendations or requirements within regarding TTM categories should be considered as a
guide.

Austroads National Training Framework for TTM

The adoption of the national training framework in WA has been put on hold, refer to section 8
for WA training and accreditation requirements.

Details of the National Austroads Training Framework are within AGTTM Part 8 and the
Austroads website.

Over the next 18 months further consultation will be undertaken with Austroads, other
jurisdictions, training providers and industry to determine the best approach for WA.

Portable Traffic Control Device (PTCD) Training

With the adoption of the Austroads TTM training on hold, there is now a gap in training for the
use of Portable Traffic Control Devices (PTCDs), which has been adopted across the rest of
Australia:

- RIIWHS206 - Control traffic with portable traffic control devices and temporary traffic
    signs
- RIIWHS303 - Position, set up and program portable traffic control devices.

Currently, many traffic management workers lack formal training specific to PTCDs, which can
impact both safety and efficiency on roadwork sites.

Recognising this issue, Main Roads is actively working on incorporating PTCD training into the
WA training framework by March 2026. This initiative aims to standardise best practices,
ensure compliance with safety regulations, and enhance the effectiveness of PTCDs. By
developing structured training programs, Main Roads seeks to improve operator competency,
reduce risks, and support the broader adoption of these devices across the road network.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 18

## 2. APPROVAL TO WORK WITHIN ROAD RESERVES

Prior to commencing works, approval must be obtained from the agency responsible for the
care, control and management of the relevant roads. Care should also be taken to ensure that
all other required authorisations are obtained prior to the commencement of works. These
might include agreement to any variations to the application of this Code of Practice and/or
AGTTM / Australian Standards, as well as any development, heritage, environmental, and
cultural clearances. Lengthy delays may be experienced if all necessary approvals are not
obtained, increasing the risk of undesired traffic incidents.

In addition to obtaining approval to work within the road reserve from the relevant Road
Authority, other agencies such as emergency services, Police, public transport etc. in the area
may need to be notified in advance of the impending works as detailed in section 4. 4.

All approvals to conduct works on roads issued by Main Roads, local governments or other
Authorities responsible for roads, must be suitably noted on the Traffic Management Plan. A
mandatory condition requiring traffic management to be carried out in accordance with the
requirements of this Code, subject to any agreed variations, must be included with the
approval.

Coordination of adjacent worksites to minimise impacts on road users must be considered
prior to approval. Approved implementation times for Traffic Management Plans and/or Traffic
Guidance Schemes are generally based on traffic capacity. Therefore, unless otherwise
stated, no devices are permitted to close traffic lanes prior to the approved start time and all
lanes must be reopened to traffic at or prior to the approved finish time.

### 2.1 ROADS FOR WHICH MAIN ROADS IS RESPONSIBLE

The Commissioner of Main Roads (CMR) is responsible for the care, control and management
of the land over which any declared ‘highway’ or ‘main road’ exists (referred to as State
Roads). Any party intending to conduct work on any State Road reserve or erect, establish,
display, alter or take down such traffic signs and traffic control devices on any State Road
must obtain prior approval from Main Roads.

To assist in determining whether a road is a State Road, visit [http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au](http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au) and
scroll down to the search bar “Which roads do Main Roads manage?”. Alternatively, to view on
a map, view the “Roads Information Mapping” map available on Main Roads’ mapping portal
at https://portal-mainroads.opendata.arcgis.com the Main Roads GPS-SLK App is also
available.

Main Roads has developed comprehensive guidelines and an application kit for those
intending to undertake work within any ‘highway’ or ‘main road’ reserve in regard to ‘complex
works’, ‘low complexity works’ or ‘utility service works’. These guidelines including contact
details and the application kit are available on the Main Roads website at
[http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au;](http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au;) go to ‘Technical and Commercial’ > ‘Working on Roads’ > ‘Third
Party Works’.

To facilitate prompt approval of applications to work on roads, persons arranging works should
contact the relevant Main Roads Regional Office at an early stage to obtain traffic information,
the level of service required on the road during the works and details of any other
requirements that need to be considered whilst preparing their Traffic Management Plans
(TMPs).


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 19

Typically, the proposed works and staging should be determined and approved in principle
prior to any TMP being produced. Once in principle approval for the works has been obtained,
the TMP designer should gain a comprehensive understanding of the project staging and then
an appropriate TMP can be produced. The TMP should be reviewed by the construction /
project manager for suitability prior to being submitted to Main Roads to review and authorise.
Depending on the complexity of the project, the time allowed for Main Roads to review should
be approximately 15 working days. For works at traffic signals refer to section 2.3.

Further information on preparing TMPs is provided in section 4 .2.

Main Roads requires submission of a TMP with all applications to work within its road
reserves. TMPs for the metropolitan area must be sent to enquiries@mainroads.wa.gov.au. If
the works are occurring outside the metropolitan area TMPs must be submitted to the relevant
regional office using the generic email address in Appendix 4.

Main Roads will, as it considers necessary, conduct audits of TMPs and refer those that do not
comply with the requirements of this Code, back to the proponent for submission of an
acceptable TMP prior to allowing commencement of works.

Any organisations with statutory authority to enter Main Roads road reserves in emergency
situations must advise the Main Roads Customer Information Centre (Ph. 1 38 138) of their
work either prior to, or as soon as possible after commencing any emergency service.

#### 2.1.1 Main Roads Policy for Works on High Volume Roads

Main Roads requires roadworks on its high-volume roads to be managed with due
consideration to traffic efficiency. A policy was established, Traffic Management at Roadworks
on State Roads Policy and Application Guidelines, to put in place elevated standards of traffic
management on high volume roads. The policy has now been superseded and the
requirements have now been incorporated into this Code, this includes:

- Controls on speed limits (see section 6.5.3),
- Lane closures (see section 6.11),
- Approach tapers and merges (see section 6.1 7 ),
- Emergency lanes (see section 6.1 8 ),
- Smart Freeways (see section 6.1 9 ), and
- Worksite access (see section 6. 20 ).

#### 2.1.2 Traffic Management Company Registration Scheme

Except in the circumstances outlined below, where traffic management is:

- being implemented on a State Road; or
- being procured by Main Roads or one of its contractors, suppliers or subcontractors
    (of any tier),
the company implementing the traffic management must be registered under the State Road
Traffic Management Company Registration Scheme (Scheme).

Registration is not required under the Scheme where it is an emergency, the traffic
management work is being carried out directly by Main Roads or the traffic management
devices being implemented on a State Road are:

- such that this Code of Practice does not require the worker to have an accreditation or
    only requires the worker to have a “Basic Worksite Traffic Management – Non-
    Practitioner” accreditation (refer section 8);
- detour signage relating to work otherwise being carried out on a non-State Road;


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 20

- related to closing a side road (that is not a State Road) from a State Road, but does
    not otherwise impede road users on the State Road (this may include using signs that
    are SIDE ROAD CLOSED, NO LEFT TURN, NO ENTRY, etc.);
- involves work that is limited only on a path for cyclists, pedestrians or both, providing
    that the users of such path are suitably catered for and other road users are not in any
    way impeded; or
- related to an ‘event’ as defined in the Traffic Management for Events Code of Practice
    and the only signage implemented on State Roads is from the Event Series (e.g.
    EVENT AHEAD, Cyclist (symbolic), EVENT ON SIDE ROAD, etc.).

For the avoidance of doubt, “impeding” includes reducing the normal travel speed (including
stopping) or deviating the normal travel path of the relevant road user.

Further information regarding the Scheme is available at
https://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au/technical-commercial/working-on-roads/

#### 2.1.3 Works on Main Roads Roads in the Metropolitan Area

Implementing approved traffic management on the Main Roads road network can often cause
congestion that may be flagged by the Road Network Operations Centre (RNOC) as an
incident.

To avoid any confusion with RNOC, and potential delays to works, it is recommended that
immediately prior to implementing approved traffic management on Main Roads controlled
roads in the metropolitan area, the traffic management personnel onsite contact the Main
Roads Road Network Operations Centre (RNOC) on 138 111.

### 2 .2 ROADS FOR WHICH LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR OTHERS ARE

### RESPONSIBLE

Any party including utility service providers who are Authorised Bodies intending to conduct
works on a road reserve that is not a declared ‘highway’ or ‘main road’, must prior to
commencing the works, contact the relevant local government or the other Authority that is
responsible for the care, control and management of the road to confirm their requirements.

### 2.4 TRAFFIC MODELLING

As of publication of the Code, The Modelling Guidelines for Roadworks - Temporary Traffic
Management is in the final approval process and due for release imminently.

The guidelines apply when the proposed temporary traffic management will redistribute traffic,
significantly lowering the level of service and safety of the surrounding road network, including
isolated intersections. This guideline will help determine the appropriate traffic analysis that will
be required.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 22

## 3. AUTHORITY TO ERECT TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES

### 3.1 MAIN ROADS

The Commissioner of Main Roads (CMR) has authority under the Road Traffic Code, to erect,
establish or display and alter or take down any road sign or traffic control signal (subsequently
referred to herein as ‘to utilise traffic signs and devices’). The CMR has delegated specified
officers of Main Roads to administer the utilisation of traffic signs and devices in accordance
with the Main Roads Delegation of Authority Manual.

### 3.2 MAIN ROADS AGENTS

Main Roads agents or contractors must, subject first to the approval of their Main Roads
Contract Manager, utilise traffic signs and devices in accordance with this Code for the
purpose of managing traffic at works on roads. Main Roads Contract Managers will comply
with the Main Roads Delegation of Authority Manual in regard to providing such approvals.

### 3.3 AUTHORISED BODIES AND THEIR AGENTS

The CMR authorises Authorised Bodies and their agents, in accordance with the provisions of
the Road Traffic Code, to utilise traffic signs and devices subject to any conditions attached to
their Instrument of Authorisation. An example of a typical ‘authorisation’ is contained in
Appendix 3.

A register of Authorised Bodies is available on Main Roads website at
[http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au;](http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au;) go to ‘Technical and Commercial’> ‘Working on Roads’ >
‘Authorised Agreements.’

### 3.4 OTHERS NOT PARTY TO AN INSTRUMENT OF AUTHORISATION

Others that are not party to an Instrument of Authorisation but need to utilise traffic signs and
devices for the purpose of managing traffic for works on a road, must first contact the Authority
responsible for the care, control and management of the road to confirm their requirements.

If the Authority responsible for the care, control and management of the road is an Authorised
Body, it will determine the requirements and approval process for others not party to an
Instrument of Authorisation. Unless advised otherwise by such Authority, the responsibility for
ensuring signs and devices are erected and maintained in accordance with this Code will, at
all times, remain with the party undertaking the works.

If the Authority responsible for the care, control and management of the road is not an
Authorised Body, authority to utilise traffic signs and devices either by such Authority itself, its
agents or contractors or, by a third party, must be obtained from Main Roads with the
concurrence of such Authority.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 23

### 3.5 AUTHORISING TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT PLANS

General Requirements

Table 5.3 of AGTTM Part 8 details the responsibilities of the Road Infrastructure Manager,
stating they are responsible for:

- ensuring that all TTM measures are in accordance with Jurisdictional requirements,
    AS1742.3 and the AGTTM.

This refers to the general responsibility of Road Infrastructure Managers to undertake a high-
level check of the proposed traffic management focussing on any issues that may present a
safety or operational risk to the road network at the location. The Road Authority or Road
Infrastructure Manager is not responsible for ensuring every aspect of the TMP is compliant
with all TTM requirements, as this is the responsibility of the TMP designer, the person who
checks the TMP (from the traffic management company) and the Roadworks Traffic Manager
(RTM) who reviews and endorses (if applicable) the TMP to ensure that the plan is compliant
with all TTM requirements.

The Road Authority has a duty of care to the safety of road users and road workers within their
jurisdiction, and as a result they should conduct a review that focuses on the TMP’s suitability
in catering for all road users, speed zone appropriateness, traffic efficiency and ensuring after
care and staging Traffic Guidance Schemes (TGS) are provided. The Suitability Check
checklist may assist officers within the road authority fulfil this obligation (see section 5.1.3).

By signing the ‘Road Authority Authorisation’ section of a Traffic Management Plan (TMP) the
Road Authority (Main Roads and/or LGA) is endorsing the implementation of temporary traffic
management on that road.

Traffic Management on Roads Controlled by Main Roads
Main Roads, or Main Roads contractors with an Instrument of Authorisation, must review and
authorise the plan as per the general requirements above.

Traffic Management on Local Government Roads
The Local Government Authority must review and authorise the plan as per the general
requirements section above.

At permanent traffic signals on local government roads Main Roads will review and authorise
the required changes to the Main Roads Traffic Signals only (see the Temporary Traffic
Management: Traffic Signal Approval Policy). Additionally, where works are on local
government roads, but it is identified that there may be an impact to nearby roads that are
controlled by Main Roads, then Main Roads must review and authorise the TMP as per the
general requirements section above.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 24

## 4. PLANNING THE WORKS

### 4.1 DUTY OF CARE

Any Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking (PCBU) in connection with or pursuant to
temporary traffic management or any works on a road, has a 'duty of care', so far as is
reasonably practicable, that the health and safety of workers who work for the PCBU or whose
activities in carrying out work are influenced or directed by the PCBU, are not exposed to
health and safety risks arising from that business or undertaking.

A PCBU must ensure, so far as reasonably practicable, that other road users are not exposed
to health and safety risks arising from any TTM business or undertaking.

A PCBU includes all types of working arrangements such as crown agencies, organisations,
companies, principals, contractors and sub-contractors.

The Work Health and Safety Act specifically requires all PCBUs to ensure, so far as is
reasonably practicable, the health and safety of:

- workers engaged, or caused to be engaged by the person
- workers whose activities in carrying out the work are influenced or directed by the
    person while the workers are at work in the business or undertaking.
- people who may be at risk from work carried out by the business or undertaking
    (including road users in case of a at roadwork sites).

### 4.2 TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT PLANS

#### 4.2.1 General

Any party undertaking work on a road must prepare a Traffic Management Plan (TMP) that
adequately provides for the safety of workers and road users while maintaining an adequate
level of service to road users. Traffic management planning should be undertaken in
accordance with the AGTTM Part 2: Traffic Management Planning.

To ensure a consistent approach is taken when developing a TMP one of the Main Roads
TMP templates^1 (see here) must be used as a basis for the development of the plan. Any
section headings that are not applicable to the TMP being developed must be kept in the
document and noted as not applicable (with the intent of keeping the TMP section numbers
the same throughout all TMPs).

For longer term projects with multiple stages and/or activities it is best practice to develop an
overarching Project Traffic Management Plan which can cover overall scope of works, staging,
project objectives, risk management, traffic analysis, communication plan, etc. and have
specific TMPs for specific work activities or stages. The TMPs that sit under the overarching
Project TMP must use the TMP template that retains section headings (where information is
captured elsewhere this can be referred to rather than it being replicated).

All TMPs must be prepared by a person holding Main Roads accreditation in Advanced
Worksite Traffic Management (AWTM). A person holding Main Roads accreditation in
Worksite Traffic Management (WTM) may make on-site modifications to the TMP in
accordance with its scope and objectives (following any modification the residual risk must not
be higher to workers or road users). Further information regarding requirements for WTM /
AWTM tasks and accreditation is provided in section 8.

(^1) Note: the basic TMP template may be used when conditions in the Basic TMP checklist (section 5) are
met. Go to [http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au](http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au) > ‘Technical & Commercial’ > ‘Working on Roads’


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 25

TMPs must be signed by the person that prepared them, along with their name, AWTM
certificate number and the date of endorsement of the plan. In addition, the person preparing
a TMP must also include a statement on the plan confirming that a site visit was undertaken by
them or another person under their direction, prior to preparing the plan along with a date
stamped photo^2 from the site visit (not required for Generic TMPs, see 4 .2.2).

With the exception of repositioning of traffic control devices within the allowable tolerances
specified in AGTTM, where any on-site changes to a TMP are proposed, such changes must
be endorsed by a person holding current WTM or AWTM accreditation. A copy of all
documentation relating to the endorsement of the changes must be held on-site by the person
managing the works.

All TMPs must contain a contingency plan for fatality and serious injuries which must detail
arrangements for preserving the worksite. See section 7.6 of AGTTM Part 6.

All Traffic Guidance Schemes (TGSs) must be signed and dated by the person that prepared
the TMP and be appropriately labelled so that those implementing the TGSs implement the
correct Traffic Management for the particular work situation (Labelling example: ‘when
clearance to traffic is less than 1.2 m’). It is recommended that all Site Specific TGSs contain
the days and times the TGS is to be implemented.

Where a TMP is to be used on more than one occasion or at a number of generic locations,
continuous improvement must be considered. This will ensure the quality of traffic
management is maintained or improved where required. The process should include debrief
meetings to discuss any issues or risks associated with the plan. TMPs must be kept up to
date considering changes in traffic volumes, vehicle types, the road environment, work
practices, legislation and/or standards. As a minimum, TMPs must be reviewed at least once
in any 12 - month period.

TMPs must not contain organisation watermarks or branding within the body of the TMP or
TGSs that obscure the text, tables and/or images. Watermarks may be placed in the header
and/or footer of the TMP.

#### 4.2.2 Generic TMPs

For routine/repetitive type works such as minor pavement maintenance, a generic TMP may
be appropriate. The person preparing the TMP must refer to the Generic/Site Specific TMP
Checklist to assist in determining whether the traffic management setup can use a generic or
site specific TMP, this is available on the Main Roads website [http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au](http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au) ; go
to ‘Technical & Commercial’ > ‘Working on Roads.’

For Generic TMPs a site visit by the AWTM that prepared the TMP^3 is not required, however
the person responsible for implementing the TMP must be aware of the scope of situations
covered in the TMP and ensure it is applicable for the site^4. Where the generic TMP is not
suitable a site specific TMP must be developed.

(^2) It is recommended the Main Roads GPS SLK App, or similar, which includes date stamp and location
information is used
(^3) RTMs may endorse Generic TMPs that do not involve ‘complex traffic arrangements’ without
undertaking a site visit, see section 4.2.3.
(^4) The TMP must be authorised for implementation by the relevant road authority, see section 3.


```
MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 26
```
```
Process for TGS Selection
```
```
Generally, Generic TMPs will contain Generic TGSs with no specific location information and
may be applicable for use at a number of locations. The Generic TMP must include a selection
procedure within the TMP to assist in the selection of the correct TGS for the road type, road
environment and the type and location of works to be undertaken (for example on shoulder or
in lane). An example TGS selection checklist is located on the Main Roads website, see here.
```
```
A TGS is defined as ‘Site Suitable’ once a Generic TGS has been selected using the defined
selection procedure, a site visit or investigation of the site is conducted, and it has been
confirmed that the selected TGS is appropriate for use for the works at that site.
```
```
All Generic TGS must be confirmed as a Site Suitable TGS prior to commencement of works.
Once the Generic TGS is confirmed as suitable for use, location information is added to the
Generic TGS. Confirmation that a Generic TGS is Site Suitable must be performed and signed
off by a BWTM, WTM or AWTM, details must be recorded in the daily diary.
```
#### 4.2.3 Traffic Management Plans Involving ‘Complex Traffic Arrangements’

```
‘Complex traffic management arrangements’ are those activities and traffic management
arrangements that include any of the following:
```
```
i. Any plan assessed as having a residual risk-rating of H (high-risk) or greater as a result
of a risk assessment undertaken during the planning stage.
```
```
ii. Any plan that meets all the following:
```
1. Occurs on a multilane road; and
2. Closes or diverts one or more lanes (includes emergency lanes); and
3. Occurs on any Freeway OR road with a permanent speed limit of 90 km/h or
    more (or a section of these roads where the speed limit is reduced due to traffic
    signals); and
4. Has a traffic volume of 15,000 vpd or more.

```
iii. Any plan at permanent traffic signals that requires:
```
1. Alteration to the function of the traffic signals or signal display (e.g. flashing
    yellow, masking displays, modifying movements or phasing); or
2. Closure of a traffic lane, including unsignalised turn lanes (including tapers or
    road closures):
       a. within a signalised intersection, or
       b. within 30 m of the stop line on the approach, or
       c. within 30 m of the adjacent stop line on the departure, or
3. Closure of any part of a signalised dedicated turning lane.

```
See the Temporary Traffic Management: Traffic Signal Policy for more details.
```
iv. Any Traffic Management arrangement involving Temporary Road Safety Barriers.

```
v. Any plan that involves the removal or replacement of permanent road safety barriers
that are preventing a potentially catastrophic outcome, e.g. commuter rail or freeway
barriers.
```
vi. Temporary diversion of traffic into the opposite lane of a multilane road creating a free-
flowing contra-flow situation (does not apply to contraflow implemented at overtaking
lanes).


```
MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 27
```
```
vii. Plans that will redistribute traffic, significantly lowering the level of service and safety of
the surrounding road network, including isolated intersections.
```
viii. Any other situation where the road authority or authorised body consider the traffic
arrangement sufficiently complex to warrant RTM review and endorsement.

```
ix. Any plan that requires a 40 km/h temporary speed limit on roads that meet all the
following:
```
1. Occurs on a multilane road; and
2. Occurs on Freeway or road with a permanent speed limit of 90 km/h or more (or
    a section of these roads where the speed limit is reduced due to traffic signals);
    and
3. Has a traffic volume of 15,000 vpd or more.

```
TMPs for works involving ‘complex traffic arrangements’ must be reviewed and endorsed by a
Roadworks Traffic Manager (RTM) in the form of their signature, the date, printed name and
RTM accreditation number. Further information regarding requirements for RTM accreditation
is provided in section 8.
```
```
TMPs for works involving ‘complex traffic arrangements’ that have been prepared by a person
holding RTM accreditation must be reviewed and endorsed by another person with RTM
accreditation.
```
```
RTMs must only endorse finalised Traffic Management Plans^5 that include a documented risk
assessment of the proposed works in accordance with Section 4.3 and Appendix 2 of this
Code, during the planning stage. A TMP must not contain a residual risk rating VH (very high-
risk) for any proposed traffic management treatment. A TMP involving a residual risk rating H
(high-risk)^6 must be reviewed and endorsed by an RTM.
```
```
Regardless of whether a particular TMP involves ‘complex traffic arrangements’ or not, the
Road Authority/Authorised Body that grants approval for the works to proceed may determine
that the TMP requires to be endorsed by an RTM.
```
```
Traffic management sites involving ‘complex traffic arrangements’ on Main Roads controlled
roads, must have at least one person with either Worksite Traffic Management or Advanced
Worksite Traffic Management accreditation on-site at all times when road workers are present.
```
```
With the exception of repositioning of traffic control devices within the allowable tolerances
specified in AGTTM, where any on-site changes to a TMP involving ‘complex traffic
arrangements’ as determined in the planning stage are proposed, such changes must be
subject to a risk assessment using the same methodology documented in the TMP (unless an
alternative methodology has been specified in the TMP). The risk assessment must be
undertaken by a person holding current Worksite Traffic Management or Advanced Worksite
Traffic Management accreditation. These changes must be within the scope and objectives of
the TMP, anything outside this will need to be endorsed by the RTM and authorised by the
relevant road authority.
```
(^5) The endorsement must be of the entire TMP not just the parts that are considered ‘complex’
(^6) Traffic flow may be exempted, traffic flow less than 135 % of the allowable capacity as detailed in
AGTTM Part 3 may be endorsed by a person with AWTM accreditation as part of a variation to
standards form, see section 6. 11.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 28

A copy of all documentation relating to the risk assessment must be held on-site by the person
managing the works. Additionally, following the on-site implementation of the changes, a copy
of this documentation must be referred back to the Roadworks Traffic Manager that endorsed
the design of ‘complex traffic arrangements’, as soon as practicable for review and feedback to
the person/contractor managing the works.

Roadworks Traffic Managers must abide by the Code of Conduct in discharging their
professional duties at all times. The Code of Conduct for Roadworks Traffic Managers is
available on Main Roads website at [http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au;](http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au;) go to ‘Technical and
Commercial’ > ‘Working on Roads’ > ‘Training and Accreditation’

As per the RTM Code of Conduct, RTMs are required to make at least one site visit prior to
endorsing a site specific^7 Traffic Management Plan. However, in regional areas that do not
have access to RTMs based within 200km of the site, RTMs may endorse complex TMPs
without the need to undertake a site visit when all the following criteria is met:

- The works associated with the TMP will be completed in less than 5 shifts (5 days).
- The TMP does not include any risks that have a residual risk rating of High or greater,
- The TMP does not involve Temporary Road Safety Barriers,
- A person with AWTM accreditation undertakes a site visit after they have consulted
    with the RTM to determine what information is required (video, photos, measurements,
    etc.).

It is important that the RTM collects and maintains photographic and video evidence provided
by the AWTM undertaking the site visit. Regardless of the above, a Road Authority /
Authorised Body reserves the right to request that an RTM undertakes a site visit in person, in
accordance with the RTM Code of Conduct.

#### 4.2.4 Temporary Road Safety Barrier Detail in TMPs

As required in section 4 .2. 3 of this code any TMP involving Temporary Road Safety Barriers
must be reviewed and endorsed by an RTM. It is the responsibility of the RTM to ensure the
TMP contains adequate barrier detail. Where temporary barriers are required, these must be
designed in accordance with manufacturer’s requirements, Austroads and Main Roads
technical guidelines. Calculations must be appended to the TMP.

TGSs must provide sufficient detail so that installers can determine offset from traffic lanes,
worksite length/width, deflection distances required, containment fences (if required), start and
finish points of the barrier, flare rates (if any) and necessary end treatments. Temporary
barriers must be rated at the appropriate test level and be an approved barrier type listed on
the Main Roads Website (Go to [http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au](http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au) ‘Technical & Commercial’ >
‘Technical Library’ > ‘Road & Traffic Engineering’ > ‘Roadside Items’ > ‘List of Approved Road
Safety Barrier Systems’).

Where temporary barriers are required, implementation methods should be detailed in the
TMP and TGSs should be prepared.

(^7) Site visit not required for Generic TMPs


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 29

#### 4.2.5 Traffic Management Implementation and Removal

The implementation, operation and/or removal of the temporary traffic management must be
considered part of the works, therefore the TMP must provide details on how this activity will
be conducted safely (refer to AGTTM Part 5 and Part 6) including order of set up and pack
down. This may require an additional TGS for the traffic management personnel to follow. The
following must be considered:

- The requirement to install and remove traffic management devices in the sequence
    described in AGTTM Part 6
- Use of shadow vehicle for protection, note a shadow vehicle is only considered a
    shadow vehicle if it is protecting workers
- Use of a look-out person when workers are no longer protected by the shadow vehicle
    e.g. crossing the road or unloading the vehicle
- A Truck Mounted Attenuator may be required to protect workers
- Traffic control may be required to safely implement a lane closure or lateral shift.
- Lane closures or traffic control may be required when installing temporary pavement
    marking or devices, such as barriers.

```
Note: it is still the responsibility of the person undertaking the traffic management activities
to be familiar with the relevant requirements detailed in AGTTM Parts 5 and 6; contents of
the TMP, including TMP risk assessment, and to ensure a thorough risk assessment, e.g.
Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS), has been prepared that covers all site-specific
risks, implemented controls for the task and this is communicated and understood by all
the traffic management crew.
```
#### 4.2.6 Adjustment and Modification of TMPs

A TMP may contain details to assist the person implementing the TGS to make adjustments to
ensure the TGS remains suitable. The details provided in the TMP or TGS must not deviate
from the conditions permitted elsewhere in this Code of Practice, unless approved as a
variation by the Road Infrastructure Manager. Where the TMP or TGS is to include additional
instruction, such instruction must align with the following as a minimum:

- Adjustments: a person with BWTM accreditation may make on-site adjustments of
    traffic control devices within the allowable tolerances indicated in AGTTM (also see
    below).
- Modifications: a person with WTM or AWTM accreditation may make on-site
    modifications to traffic control devices outside of tolerances. This includes modifying,
    adding and/or removing signs and devices where the intent/objectives of the TMP and
    operation of the road network are not adversely impacted. Changes to the TMP/TGS
    must not involve adding lane or road closures, speed limit changes, or adding any
    additional regulatory signs that have not been approved. Adding repeater speed
    restriction signs is permitted.
- Substantial modifications: more substantial modifications must be made by a person
    with AWTM accreditation and must be authorised by the Road Infrastructure Manager
    (with associated RTM endorsement where required). Note: this is likely to result in a
    new revision of the TMP.

All adjustments and modifications are to be risk assessed, recorded on the TMP and/or TGS
and recorded in the daily diary.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 30

For clarity tolerances from AGTTM Part 6 are detailed below:

```
a. Tolerances for placement of signs are:
i. up to 10% less than the distances given
ii. up to 25% more than the distances given
b. Tolerances for placement of delineation is:
i. no minimum and up to 10% more the distances given
c. Tolerances for taper lengths are:
i. up to 10% less than the distances given
ii. up to 25% more than the distances given
```
### 4.3 RISK MANAGEMENT

Management of risk is central to a TMP.

The risk management process for the planning of the works must be in accordance with
AGTTM Part 2: Traffic Management Planning and Appendix 2 of this Code and included within
the TMP.

The risk management process is applicable at all levels of planning, design and operation.
Refer to the AGTTM series for additional guidance.

The following must be considered when undertaking the risk management process for any
activities on or near roads:

- the Work Health and Safety (General) Regulations 2022 identify construction work on
    or near roads as high-risk construction work,
- A Safe Work Method Statement must be prepared before high-risk construction work
    commences (as per WHS Regulations),
- AGTTM indicates that all works on roads are considered high risk,
- Main Roads has corporately identified worker interaction with live traffic as a critical
    risk,
- Obligations of the PCBU to manage risks to health and safety in accordance with Part
    3.1 of the Work Health and Safety (General) Regulations 2022:
       o Duty to identify reasonably foreseeable hazards; and
       o eliminate risks to health and safety so far as is reasonably practicable; and
       o if it is not reasonably practicable to eliminate risks to health and safety – minimise
          those risks so far as is reasonably practicable, through:
             ▪ implementing the hierarchy of controls; and
             ▪ monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the control measures.

Taking this into account it would usually be expected that the pre-treatment risk ratings for
works (including traffic management set up and pack down^8 ) near live traffic would have a pre-
treatment risk rating of high or greater, i.e. it is recognised that it is possible that workers may
suffer major injuries or severe permanent disablement when working near traffic with no
treatments or controls in place (e.g. engineering, administrative, PPE, etc.). Ensure current
Main Roads’ risk classification table is used and the alphanumeric codes from Table A2-4 are
included as per the example below.

(^8) Risk rating must be included in the TMP for traffic management set up and pack down.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 31

Example pre-treatment risk rating (note this is the risk rating with no controls in place):

```
Risk Event Consequence Pre-treatment Risk
Likelihood Consequence Risk Rating
Distracted or impaired
motorist may crash
into workers setting
up the traffic
management.
```
```
Serious injury to
workers.
```
```
Likely (B) Major (4) Very High
(16)
```
AGTTM Part 10: Supporting Guidance provides specific guidance on the risk management
process for temporary traffic management, this is generally supported in WA however the
tables in appendix 2 of this code should be used for:

- consequence / impact (Table A2-1 and A2-2),
- measures of likelihood (Table A2-3),
- risk rating matrix (Table A2-4), and
- treatment / management approach (table A2-5).

### 4. 4 CONSULTATION, COMMUNICATION AND NOTIFICATION OF

### ROADWORKS

Roadworks have the potential to cause significant delays or access problems, or create
adverse impacts on existing road infrastructure such as traffic signals, railway crossings,
bridges, etc. Stakeholder consultation and/or communication is an essential part of preparing a
TMP. For example, the relocation or diverting of traffic using lane closures or detours can
change loading dynamics or introduce additional loadings on nearby bridges to the extent that
bridge capacities and load restrictions may be exceeded.

It is important that where traffic is to be detoured via an existing road network, the road
authority responsible for roads forming the detour is notified of the traffic arrangements during
the planning of the works, i.e. when preparing the Traffic Management Plan (see section 4 .2).

It is the responsibility of the individual or organisation proposing to undertake works to ensure
all relevant stakeholders are appropriately notified of the works and subsequent impacts on
traffic conditions.

#### 4.4.1 Consultation

Consultation is an essential part of the preparation of a TMP, including consultation with the
road authority. It is also important to consult with any stakeholders who have an understanding
of site features and constraints, and who will be impacted by the implementation of the traffic
management plan. Examples of stakeholders to be consulted include:

- road authorities
- residents and landowners
- local businesses
- schools
- public transport providers
- road infrastructure managers


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 32

Transperth

If planned road works are impacting Transperth bus services or bus stops* approval must be
obtained from a member of the Transperth Service Disruption Team
(Transperth.ServiceDisruptions@pta.wa.gov.au) ensuring they are satisfied with proposed
detours and bus stop closure or relocations. The PTA will require a minimum of 5 working
days’ notice to review any plans or traffic guidance schemes. A TGS indicating the bus detour
and/or bus stop relocations must be provided.

```
* Transperth approval is not required for any roadworks occurring on residential streets
for a short duration (less than two hours and outside of peak times); however, they will
still require of Notification of Roadworks form.
```
**Children’s Crossings and School Zones**

Children’s crossings in Western Australia are installed under the approval of a State
Government appointed committee known as the Children’s Crossings and Road Safety
Committee. Once approved, Main Roads and the relevant local government install children’s
crossing infrastructure to strict guidelines. Unless in an emergency, under no circumstance
must a children’s crossing be closed, moved or interfered with for the purpose of any works
without seeking advice from the Children’s Crossing and Road Safety Committee via the
Western Australia Police Children’s Crossing Unit.

Where works are located within a School Zone, consideration must be given to undertake the
works outside the period indicated on the school zone sign or in school holidays. Where this
cannot be done OR where a children’s crossing is located within a roadwork’s site, the
following actions must be taken:

- Consult with the Western Australian Police Children’s Crossing Unit at the planning
    stage to agree on and finalise arrangements for the safe passage of school children
    and pedestrians.
- Ensure the speed shown on the temporary speed zone and termination signage is less
    than or equal to the speed shown on the school zone sign during the school zone
    operating times. In cases where the worksite extends beyond the school zone,
    termination signage must reflect the posted speed applicable to that section of road.
- Where the children’s crossing stop line and side bollard have been removed as part of
    the roadworks, traffic controllers must be positioned at the location of the children’s
    crossing stop line(s) to guide vehicles where to stop on the approach side of the
    children’s crossing.
- Where roadworks alters normal traffic paths during the operating times of a children’s
    crossing, traffic controllers must assist the Traffic Warden to control vehicles and
    pedestrians at the children’s crossing as required. If a Traffic Warden is not available,
    the crossing cannot be managed as a children's crossing. However, Main Roads
    accredited traffic controllers may be utilised to ensure the safe operation of the
    crossing in the same manner as other priority pedestrian crossings are temporarily
    managed.
- Provisions for pedestrian and bicycle facilities must be in accordance with AGTTM.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 33

Railway Crossings (Including Crossings without Flashing Signals)

Any works within the distances from a railway level crossing given in Table 3 and are likely to
result in realignment of a road section or intersection impacting on the railway level crossing or
significantly affecting the existing traffic flow through a railway level crossing, the relevant Rail
Infrastructure Manager must be notified at least two (2) weeks prior to the works by the party
arranging the works. The Rail Infrastructure Manager may determine a Rail Safety
Management Plan (RSMP) is required for roadworks which impact on the safe operation of the
railway.

```
Table 3 - Distances from railway level crossings where significantly impacting crossing
```
```
Speed limit (km/h) Distance from railway (m)
```
```
<70 150
70 to 90 200
>90 300
```
Traffic Controllers need to be aware that motorists will generally follow their directions when
they differ from other signals, signs and devices on the road. They need to take special care
at railway crossings to ensure they do not direct traffic through signals requiring vehicles to
stop, unless it is clearly safe for vehicles to proceed through them.

Where a railway level crossing exists within a section being controlled by a Traffic Controller, a
flag person with the relevant Track Access Permit should be stationed at the traffic stop line of
the railway crossing at least 3m from the nearest rail, equipped with a two-way radio, to watch
for trains and advise the Traffic Controllers to stop traffic in time for train movements through
the level crossing.

The flag person should make sure that the relevant Rail Infrastructure Manager has been
notified before their commences work. On each day, prior to the commencement of works, the
Rail Infrastructure Manager should be advised of the works that will be proceeding on that day,
so that train drivers can be warned of the works and advice can be received on the times that
trains are expected to use the crossing (this will be determined by the relevant Rail
Infrastructure Manager).

If the section of road under traffic control is to one side of the railway level crossing, but within
the distances in Table 3 , the flag person stationed at the railway level crossing must be
stationed on the same side of the crossing as the section under traffic control, at the traffic
stop line or at least 3 m from the nearest rail. The flag person stationed at the railway level
crossing must be equipped with a hand-held STOP/SLOW sign that has the rear ‘SLOW’ sign
covered. This is to prevent vehicles approaching the other side of the railway level crossing
following the SLOW instruction and ignoring other signs or flashing signals.

Traffic Controllers must also ensure that vehicles stopped do not queue back over a railway
level crossing. If there is a chance of this happening, vehicles should be stopped prior to the
railway level crossing.

Refer to the Railway Crossing Control in Western Australia Policy and Guidelines on the Main
Roads website at [http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au](http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au) > ‘Technical & Commercial > ‘Technical Library’
> ‘Traffic Management’ > ‘Railway Crossing Control’


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 34

#### 4.4.2 Notification of Approved Roadworks

Notification of approved Roadworks must be sent using the form in Appendix 4 at least seven
(7) days prior to works commencing, in the following situations.
Note: the notification form does not replace the need to consult with relevant stakeholders.
(a ‘Word’ document version of the Notification of Roadworks Form is available on Main Roads
website at [http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au;](http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au;) go to ‘Technical & Commercial’ > ‘Working on Roads’.)
There may be other stakeholders that require notification that aren’t listed. Only stakeholders
impacted should be sent the form:

- Works involving the complete closure of any road (may not apply to access roads, however
    residents must be notified).
- Works on primary and district distributor roads of more than four (4) hours duration where it
    is expected that traffic delays and congestion will occur.
- Traffic management activities involving the establishment of a contra-flow.
- Traffic management activities resulting in any direct or indirect changes to traffic flows
    and/or traffic composition on bridges, including situations where such changes are a result
    of lane closures or traffic detours.
- Works on any primary or district distributor road where construction activities will make it
    difficult or impossible for the passage of general access or oversize vehicles, and traffic
    control devices cannot be easily shifted on a temporary basis to allow the vehicle to pass.
- Traffic management activities that prohibit turning movements at signalised intersections.
- Works occurring through any Traffic Warden controlled children’s crossing.
- Any other activities where major impact on stakeholders are expected.

It is essential that the relevant road authority is informed of all communications or notifications
planned and/or executed to support the implementation of traffic management.

For all works requiring the complete or partial closure of a road, an outline of the planned
communications should accompany the Notification of Roadworks form. Where applicable,
contact details for the communications coordinator (or equivalent) should also be provided.

### 4.5 VARIATION TO THE CODE, AGTTM AND STANDARDS

The Code of Practice, AS1742.3 and AGTTM contain mandatory requirements (must or shall)
and recommendations (should). The application of these mandatory requirements and
recommendations is intended to provide the optimal level of safety and traffic efficiency.

Variations to these treatments may be undertaken as follows:
a) Where recommendations (should) are not adopted when preparing the TMP, this must
be included within the risk assessment within the TMP.
b) Where mandatory requirements (must or shall) are not adopted in preparing a TMP, a
risk assessment undertaken by a Roadworks Traffic Manager (see section 4.3) must
be undertaken and the approval for the variation must be obtained from the relevant
Road Infrastructure Manager using the Variation to Standards Application Form
available from the Main Roads website [http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au;](http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au;) go to ‘Technical &
Commercial > ‘Working on Roads’ When undertaking the variation to standard the
RTM must review and endorse the entire TMP.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 35

### 4.6 VULNERABLE ROAD USERS

Vulnerable road users include pedestrians (including pedestrians with disabilities) cyclists and
motorcyclists. Vulnerable road users must be considered for all works on roads, refer to
AGTTM for more information.

Primary Path Closures in the Metropolitan Area

Any planned works in the Perth Metropolitan* area that require a closure of an existing path
designated by the Department of Transport as a Primary Route* for a period of 7 days or
more:

- Must obtain approval from the Main Roads Planned Interventions (RPI) section,
    ensuring they are satisfied with the proposed detours. RPI will require a minimum of 15
    working days' notice to review the TMP and associated TGS.
- Must include a Traffic Guidance Scheme indicating the path detour; and the proposed
    signs have been endorsed by a person that holds RTM accreditation (along with
    endorsing the entire TMP). The RTM must have undertaken a site visit of the proposed
    detour (visiting the entire proposed route).
- Must have a compliance safety inspection (refer to section 5.1.2) of all Primary Path
    Route detours, conducted by a person that holds AWTM accreditation within 24 hours
    of implementation (this must be taken from the perspective of a path user). This must
    be submitted to Main Roads Planned Interventions (RPI) section via
    enquiries@mainroads.wa.gov.au

*DoT website: Long-term cycle network (transport.wa.gov.au)
Perth Metropolitan area, as per Perth and Peel Long Term Cycle Network, excludes Peel: i.e.
City of Mandurah, Shire of Waroona, and Shire of Murray excluded.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 36

## 5. REVIEW, INSPECTION, ROAD SAFETY AUDIT AND OPERATION

### 5.1 REVIEW, INSPECTION AND ROAD SAFETY AUDIT

AGTTM Part 10: Supporting Guidance section 3 provides requirements for conducting
reviews, inspections and road safety audits at temporary traffic management. WA has the
below variations and additions to AGTTM.

#### 5.1.1 Audits

Generally, in WA rather than Senior Road Safety Auditors conducting Roadworks TMP and
TGS design phase road safety audits, Roadworks Traffic Managers (RTM) conduct the below
Temporary Traffic Management audits (the RTM may also be a Senior Road Safety Auditor).

Suitability Audit
A Suitability Audit is a systematic and independent examination of the extent to which the
proposed Traffic Management Plan addresses specified requirements and provides a measure
of the project’s capability in meeting those requirements. This audit is conducted by an RTM
prior to the implementation of the TMP. The RTM:

- audits the entire TMP and all TGSs;
- audits against contractual requirements;
- considers all safety issues related to the traffic management including crash risks;
- considers traffic flow and efficiency;
- inspects the site;
- writes an audit report, see template here;
- holds a completion meeting with relevant site personnel, e.g. project manager, traffic
    manager, etc.

Compliance Audit
A Compliance Audit is a systematic and independent examination of the extent to which a
project fulfils its traffic management requirements (including the Traffic Management Plan) and
provides a measure of the project’s performance in meeting specified requirements. This audit
is conducted by an RTM after a TMP/TGS has been implemented and may be conducted at
various stages of the project. The RTM:

- audits the entire TMP and all TGSs (may only be able to cover off the implementation
    of the TGS in place at the time of the audit);
- audits against contractual requirements;
- considers all safety issues related to the traffic management including crash risks;
- considers traffic flow and efficiency;
- inspects the site;
- writes an audit report, see template here;
- holds a completion meeting with relevant site personnel, e.g. project manager, traffic
    manager, etc.

#### 5.1.2 Suitability Reviews and Compliance Safety Inspections

Refer to AGTTM Part 10 (sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2) for details on Suitability Reviews and
Compliance Safety Inspections. These have the same requirements as those listed in the
Suitability/Compliance audits above except these are conducted by a person with AWTM
accreditation and a full report does not have to be produced (can also be undertaken by an
RTM).
Note: Site supervisor compliance (operational) safety inspections, as described in section
3.3.2 of AGTTM Part 10, may be conducted by a person that does not hold AWTM
accreditation.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 37

#### 5.1.3 Suitability Check

A suitability check is a check of the traffic management plan to ensure it addresses the
specified requirements of the works, all types of traffic and the road environment. This includes
a check of compliance with standards and the identification and mitigation of all site specific
and operational risks.

This check ensures the TMP is appropriate prior to being implemented.

- Conducted by AWTM or WTM (or person within road authority with equivalent level of
    knowledge and experience).
- Conducted prior to implementation.
- Does not require a report to be written.
- Desktop check that does not require a site visit.

Note: it is good practice for traffic planners to have someone undertake this type of check
before submitting the TMP to the road authority.

#### 5.1.4 Review and Audit Checklists

Checklists have been developed to assist personnel to prepare, review, audit, approve and / or
authorise traffic management plans. The checklists are located on the Main Roads website at
[http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au:](http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au:) ‘Technical & Commercial’ > ‘Working on Roads’


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 38

### 5.2 TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT OPERATION AND RECORDS

It is a requirement that any party undertaking work on or alongside a road, must keep a copy
of the current approved TMP onsite. Daily records of the sign arrangement or traffic guidance
scheme must be kept in a diary in accordance with AGTTM Part 6: Field Staff –
Implementation. As a minimum, the Daily Diary must be based on the Daily Diary Template on
the Main Roads website [http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au;](http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au;) go to Technical & Commercial’ >
‘Working on Roads’

Due to the availability of smart phones and video cameras, when conducting workplace
inspections and/or altering the traffic guidance scheme, video evidence should be considered
(to support written documented records).

Claims for damages are often made a considerable time after an incident. Under the
Limitation Act (WA), claims for negligence must be commenced within six (6) years. However,
a defendant may be unaware that an action has commenced for a further year as the plaintiff
has this time in which to serve the writ.

Main Roads recommends that traffic management written records (i.e. TMP and daily diary) be
securely stored for a period of not less than seven (7) years from the date of completion of the
works. The Authorised Body that grants approval to a Traffic Management Plan should keep a
copy of the approved Traffic Management Plan and any daily records of their supervisory staff
that capture the on-going implementation of the Traffic Management Plan.

In case of all works undertaken for or on behalf of Main Roads, the persons arranging the
traffic management works must keep their own daily records in addition to a copy of the
approved TMP together with any other relevant records.

For all other works the requirements for record keeping in relation to traffic management must
be determined by the Authorised Body responsible for or authorising the work.

Video Drive Throughs

Any organisation implementing temporary traffic management on a Main Roads worksite (i.e.
works conducted by or on behalf of Main Roads) must conduct video drive throughs (using a
Dash Cam or similar) as per the inspection schedule, to record the implemented traffic
guidance scheme.

This video^9 must be stored for a period of 7 days from date of recording and provided to Main
Roads when or if requested. After 7 days, if not requested by Main Roads, footage can be
deleted or overwritten.

This does not apply to Short Term Low Impact Worksites as per AGTTM Part 5, Mobile Works
as per AGTTM Part 4, Events as defined in the Traffic Management for Events Code of
Practice; or responding to Emergencies or Incident management.

(^9) Video to have a frame rate of at least 3 frames per second (FPS)


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 39

## 6. DEPARTURES FROM DESIGN REQUIRMENTS IN AS1742.3 AND AGTTM

The following departures to the requirements of AS 1742.3, AGTTM and other additional
requirements are to be applied to temporary traffic management in Western Australia.

### 6.1 TEMPORARY SIGNAGE

#### 6.1.1 General

Any signage that is not within the AS 1742 series needs to be approved by Main Roads before
it can be implemented on the road network. All Main Roads approved signage is on the Main
Roads website at [http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au;](http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au;) go to ‘Technical & Commercial’ > ‘Technical
Library’ > ‘Signs Index’. Warning and regulatory signs should not be altered or modified;
particularly regulatory signs which may become unenforceable.

Main Roads is still in the process of transitioning to adopt new Australian Standards signs
within AS1743 Road signs _–_ Specifications that replicate the Main Roads temporary signs.
Until this process is finalised Main Roads signs with sign numbers and specifications should
continue to be used. Where there is no Main Roads equivalent sign, signs within the AS1742 /
AS1743 series may be used. (Note: signs for road and path closures within AS1742.3 may be
used, see section 6.1.8).

The signs must be sourced from an approved sign maker. This ensures the sign sheeting
materials are in accordance with the required standards. The list of approved manufacturers is
available in Specifications 601 – Signs, which can be found on the Main Roads website
[http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au](http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au) (‘Technical & Commercial’ > ‘Technical Library’) refer to Annexure
601 I ‘Sign Makers Accredited by Retroreflective Sheeting Manufacturers’.

Note: Australian Standard or Main Roads signs usually used for permanent installation may be
used at temporary traffic management sites as appropriate.

#### 6.1.2 REDUCE SPEED Signs

The REDUCE SPEED sign should be used at worksites with a posted speed limit greater than
60 km/h when reducing the speed by 30 km/h or more.

The signs should be placed on both sides of the carriageway, in advance of the lowest speed
zone at the worksite. Distances prior to the sign and the temporary speed limit are provided in
the table below.

```
Speed of Traffic
200 m prior to sign
(km/h)
```
```
Distance (m)
```
```
60 or less 25
```
```
70 - 110 Half the traffic speed (km/h)
```
```
Table 4 – REDUCE SPEED sign spacing
```
When used in conjunction with a temporary speed limit sign in a multi-message sign
arrangement, the REDUCE SPEED panel should be placed within the same multi message
frame.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 40

##### G9- 9

#### 6.1.3 NEW WORK NO LINES MARKED Signing

The NEW WORK NO LINES MARKED signs (T3-11, T3- 1 2 and MMS-RC-3) are used to warn
road users of the absence of line marking, see clause 4.9.3 of AS1742.3 – 2019.

Other than at an active work area these signs may be used without requiring the use of other
advance warning signs (e.g. ROADWORK AHEAD), provided that the normal running lanes
are not obstructed and there are no longer temporary roadside hazards at the worksite.

##### T3-11 T3- 12

#### 6.1.4 ROAD INSPECTION Sign

The below ROAD INSPECTION sign may be displayed on vehicles which are used for road
inspections. The signs must be located on the roof or rear of the vehicle and must not obscure
vehicle mounted warning devices.

##### MR-TVM- 15

#### 6.1.5 CYCLIST DISMOUNT Sign

Prior to undertaking any works that impact on bicycle paths this Code and AGTTM require
these works to be planned to ensure cyclist safety whilst minimising disruption and
inconvenience. Bicycle paths should be provided with the same scale and width as existing
facilities. However, it is acknowledged that sometimes when conducting short term
maintenance works on shared paths and bicycle paths it may not be practical to provide a
surface that is suitable for all bicycles.

In the first instance other warning signs to warn riders of the surface condition and the need to
reduce speed must be displayed.

As a last resort, where cyclists cannot physically traverse the surface, the CYCLISTS
DISMOUNT sign may be used. Therefore, any use of the CYCLIST DISMOUNT sign will only
be for short durations and with the approval of the relevant road authority.

Note: The inappropriate use of this sign will result in riders failing to dismount where
instructed.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 41

##### MMS-PED- 7

#### 6.1.6 Pedestrian Warning Signs for Motorists

Along with the requirements detailed in section 3.8.3 of AGTTM Part 3 for contraflow
arrangements, the use of the Pedestrian Warning sign (MR-TAW-31) may be used to provide
warning to motorists at locations that have pedestrian crossings.

```
MR-TAW- 31
```
#### 6.1.7 Repeater Speed Restriction Signs

At locations where the A size speed restriction sign, R4-1A (450 x 600 mm), is permitted in
AS1742.3, the MMS-REG-1 (600 x 600 mm) may be used as a standalone sign only when
used as a repeater speed sign and if it is within a purpose made frame.

#### 6.1.8 ROAD CLOSED and FOOTPATH CLOSED Signs

The Australian Standard ROAD CLOSED (T2-4, TM2-4B and TM2-4C) and FOOTPATH
CLOSED (T8-4 and TM8-4A) signs with black legend on white background, in AS1742.3 2019,
are now supported for use in WA. Signs with black legend on yellow background are still
permitted to be used, however these will be phased out in the future.

```
TM 2 - 4C
```
#### 6.1.9 Sign Spacing

Where a physical constraint on site impacts locating the sign(s) as per the spacing
requirements in Table 2.2 of AGTTM Part 3 signs can be modified by a person with AWTM
accreditation to:
i. Up to 10 % less than the distance given
ii. Up to 25 % or 15 m more than the distance given (whichever is greater)

Where there is only a single advanced sign, or single advance Multi Message Sign (MMS)
frame, for approach speeds of 60 km/h or less, the sign may be positioned at the spacing
shown in table 2.2 of AGTTM Part 3, i.e. the sign does not have to be double the spacing as
required in section 2.5.3 of AGTTM Part 3. Refer to section 6.5 for setting out temporary speed
zones.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 42

```
Figure 1: Example single advance sign
```
Note: sign may not be required on both sides of the road. Figure only shown to indicate a sign
on both sides may still be considered a ‘single advanced sign.’

#### 6.1.10 Advance Warning on Freeways and High-Speed High-Volume Roads

Where advance warning signs (including vehicle or trailer mounted VMS) are required they
may be omitted at worksites where the following applies:

- The removal of the advance warning is supported by a risk assessment undertaken by
    an RTM; and
- A TMA is deployed to protect the work area (TMA to display required TTM signs) OR
    the work area is behind a road safety barrier; and
- The work area, including TMA, is not located within a running lane (e.g. works on
    verge, shoulder or emergency lane); and
- A speed buffer zone is not required prior to the worksite; and
- Approaching vehicles have at least 200 m of sight distance to the worksite.

#### 6.1.11 U-Turn DETOUR Ahead Sign

The U-Turn DETOUR Ahead sign (MMS-DIV-10) may be used where a detour route involves
traffic undertaking a U-turn. Traffic should only be directed to undertake a U-turn at
roundabouts or at traffic signals where U-turns are permitted.

The U-Turn DETOUR ahead sign may be used as a standalone sign if it is within a purpose
made frame. Alternatively, if there are no relevant messages that may be added to the
assembly two blanks (600 x 600) may be added to the MMS frame when using the sign.

```
MMS-DIV- 10
```
#### 6.1.12 Detour Signs

Signing for detours must be in accordance with AS1742.3 and AGTTM. However, the below
wording from section 3.7 of AGTTM Part 3 is considered an error and does not apply in WA:

```
The first detour marker must be placed no more than 100 m past the DETOUR AHEAD
sign (or VMS). Detour markers are mounted horizontally with the arrow either vertically
upward, at 45 degrees upwards to the left or right, or horizontally to the left or right.
```

MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 43

### 6.2 GUIDELINES FOR MULTI-MESSAGE SIGNS

#### 6.2.1 Introduction

Multi Message Signs (MMS) have now been included in both AS1742.3- 2019 and AS1743
Road signs _–_ Specifications. However, Main Roads is still in the process of determining the
transition from Main Roads to the Australian Standard equivalent sign. Until this process is
finalised Main Roads MMS should continue to be used, where there is no Main Roads
equivalent MMS, signs within the AS1742.3 may be used.

#### 6.2.2 Frames for Multi-Message Signs

See clause 4.5.2 of AS1742.3-2019. Further information on frame specifications can be found
on the Main Roads website [http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au](http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au) (‘Technical & Commercial’ > ‘Technical
Library’) and Main Roads Specification 601 – Signs.

#### 6.2.3 Substrates for Multi-Message Signs

A variety of different materials can be used for the sign substrates including the following:

- 5 mm core flute
- Aluminium
- UV stabilised plastic

The substrates for the signs must be of sufficient thickness and rigidity to prevent the signs
being blown out of the frame.

The signs must be sourced from an approved sign maker. This ensures the sign sheeting
materials are in accordance with the required standards. The list of approved manufacturers is
available in Specifications 601 – Signs, which can be found on the Main Roads website
[http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au](http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au) (‘Technical & Commercial’ > ‘Technical Library’) refer to Annexure
601 I ‘Sign Makers Accredited by Retroreflective Sheeting Manufacturers’.

The rear of the sign substrate must be non-reflective.

When using core flute multi-message signs at worksites where the signs will be operating both
day and night or the signs will be left unattended, there must be at least two (2) 5 mm thick
core flute signs back-to-back in the multi-message frame to help prevent the sign from blowing
out and /or sliding across (if back-to-back messages are not required the rear set of panels
must show the blank/rear plate).


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 44

#### 6.2.4 Selection and Use of Multi-Message Signs

The use of multi-message signs must comply with the following requirements, this replaces
conditions of use for MMS as detailed in clause 4.2.2 of AS1742.3:

```
a) All Main Roads approved Multi-Message Signs are on the Main Roads website at
http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au; go to ‘Technical & Commercial’ > ‘Technical Library’ >
‘Signs Index’ > Multi Message Signs’. For the sign application schedule refer to
Appendix 5.
```
```
b) Regulatory control message plates, where used must always be positioned closest to
traffic and reflect conditions.
```
```
c) Regulatory signs must not be used in-conjunction with the NEXT ‘x’ km or ‘x’ km
AHEAD message plates.
```
```
d) Lane status 600 x 600 message plate must only contain two lane instruction (arrow)
messages. Lane status 1200 x 600 message plates may contain up to 4 lane
instruction messages.
```
```
e) Multi–message sign assembly should, where practical, be duplicated on both sides of
the road or carriageway, of the road to which the signs apply or as recommended by
Australian Standards (note: Speed changes must be duplicated).
```
```
f) All sections of the frame assembly must be filled with an approved sign. Messages
should be logically linked, and conflicting messages should not be used.
```
```
i. Except as noted in the schedule, where used, at least one of the 600 x 600
panels must be symbolic.
ii. Duplication of the same messages on the same multi-message sign must be
avoided.
```

### 6.3 SECURING SIGNS AND DEVICES

#### 6.3.1 Securing Signs

Requirement to Secure Signs

AS 1742.3 requires that signs and devices must be positioned and erected so that they are
properly displayed and securely mounted. This requirement applies irrespective of the length
of time that the sign is displayed, where the sign is located or the environmental conditions.

Factors that influence the risk of fallen signs are:

- Wind force; travel speeds; sign offset from the edge line; the presence of road trains
    and expected weather conditions,
- Slope of ground; with steeper batters increasing the risk,
- Duration that the sign is place; longer duration increases risk.

Requirements Where Sign is Required for More than 14 Days

Signs must be mounted on permanent posts^11 where required at that location for more than 14
days, where permanent posts are proposed not to be used, a risk assessment by an RTM
must first be undertaken to detail why they are not being installed and provide mitigation such
as regular maintenance arrangements or additional supports.

Requirements for Signs not Mounted on Permanent Posts

At locations where signs are not mounted on permanent posts the signs must be securely
mounted.

Where workers are not available to immediately identify and rectify fallen signs, the securing of
signs must include one of the following methods:

- Sandbags (or similar) on all 4 legs (total weight of at least 40 kg)*
- Affixing to other suitable permanent roadside infrastructure^12
- Semi-permanent mounting of permanent posts (in accordance with manufacturers
    specifications) e.g. Oz Spike or similar

*The lateral offset to the travelled way and the speed of passing traffic have a significant
impact on the risk of signs falling over, the number of sandbags may be reduced to the figures
indicated in the table 5 below (other factors such as number of heavy vehicles and weather
conditions must also be considered).

```

```
(^11) Permanent posts and mounting in accordance with Main Roads Specification 601
(^12) Signs must not be affixed to road safety barriers. If affixing to permanent sign posts ensure the
permanent sign is covered or removed if required.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 46

Further Requirements and Considerations

Irrespective of the speed environment, the following options must also be considered, to
further mitigate the risk if signs do fall over:

- Regular monitoring and maintenance in place to rectify fallen signs
- Use of Portable Variable Message Signs in advance of the work site

There may be a need to use a combination of the above methods on any particular site and
some form of monitoring will always be required. For example, use of permanent posts for the
ROADWORK AHEAD and initial speed reduction signs required for the entire duration of the
project but temporary sign legs for the traffic control warning signs that need to be removed
and/or relocated throughout the works.

If a sign has fallen over, measures must be taken to stop this from reoccurring. This may
include weighing down the legs, safely fastening the device to suitable objects or post
mounting the sign.

Note: Project / Contract Managers should ensure the above is considered in contract
documentation, ensuring appropriate resources and personnel are provided for the required
method of installation and monitoring.

#### 6.3.2 Securing Cones and Bollards

When using cones or bollards at high-risk locations and it is expected they will blow over due
to windy conditions, heavy vehicles or traffic speed, the following must be considered to
ensure additional stability:

- bollards to have a base of 12 kg (or two 6 kg bases can be used);
- cones be a minimum of 6 kg (or 3 kg cones can be doubled up, i.e. 2 stacked on top of
    each other).

Alternatively, bollards or cones can be fixed to the pavement (with approval from the road
owner).

Examples of high-risk locations include lateral shifts on high-speed roads, devices separating
the work area, devices delineating excavations, etc.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 47

### 6.4 COVERING EXISTING SIGNAGE AND ROAD MARKING

#### 6.4.1 Existing Signs

In accordance with Clause 4.2.5 of AS 1742.3 - 2019 ‘Any signs and traffic control devices,
including regulatory, warning guide signs and pavement marking, which are inappropriate to,
or conflict with, the temporary worksite situation must be covered, obliterated or removed’.

Where it is necessary to cover a sign face temporarily, caution must be exercised as some
coverings will cause permanent damage to the sign face following exposure to moisture and
sunlight e.g. plastic materials, especially black, is forbidden as it is known that these materials
are responsible for severe and permanent damage within 24 hours.

Specifications for covering existing signage can be found in Main Roads Specification 601 –
Signs, located on the Main Roads website at [http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au;](http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au;) go to ‘Technical &
Commercial’ > ‘Tender Preparation’ > ‘Specifications’ > ‘600 Series – Traffic Facilities’

#### 6.4.2 Covering Regulatory Road Marking

In addition to the requirement to remove or cover regulatory devices that the TMP forces road
users to contravene; it is recommended that regulatory road marking that portray a speed limit
or traffic movement different to that shown in the TMP be covered.

Covering the road marking can be done with sticker products available from most sign makers.
The colour of the sticker selected must be similar to colour of the road surface. Long-term
work sites should use the grinding and reinstatement method OR undertake routine inspection
and maintenance on the stickers.

Where not possible to cover arrow pavement marking, lane status signs must be provided that
depict the permitted movements under the TGS.

### 6.5 SPEED LIMIT ZONES

#### 6.5.1 Approval of Temporary Speed Limit Signs

Authorised bodies are permitted to erect temporary speed limit signs without approval from
Main Roads. However, all temporary speed limit signs on State Roads must be approved by
Main Roads prior to their use, approval must come from the authorised officer listed in section
11 .1, Traffic Signs, of the Main Roads Delegation of Authority (note this applies to all traffic
signs and devices).

#### 6.5.2 Setting out Temporary Speed Zones

This section has been prepared to provide additional guidance to section 5.5 of AGTTM Part 3
for designing temporary speed zones.

Main Roads requires the values (listed in Table 6 ) be used whenever temporary speed zones
are required, unless a site-specific hazard is identified, and a risk assessment determines the
need to extend the sign placement. This must be documented in the risk assessment and
response table of the TMP.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 48

```
(a) Buffer zones – 110 km/h to 40 km/h
```
```
(b) No buffer zone required with 40 km/h work area speed limit (where posted speed limit
less than 80 km/h).
```
Notes:

1. Transition Area, e.g. tapers, crossover, etc., may be within speed buffer prior to the
    work area speed limit;
2. Safety buffer may be within the work area speed limit (based on a risk assessment)
3. Illustrations do not show all signs and devices that will be required at the worksite.
4. Refer to AGTTM Part 3 for details on the termination area

```
Table 6 - Placement of temporary speed limit signs
```
Notes:

These spacings are required for the majority of scenarios. However, where a risk assessment
determines that spacings need to be changed they must be changed in line with AS1742.3
and AGTTM Part 3. Where the spacing does not comply with either Table 6 or AGTTM a
variation must be undertaken as per section 4.5.

The reduced speed zone should be as short as possible and should not commence so far prior
to the hazard (or workers) that drivers start to disregard the speed limit. The distance provided
in L3 indicates the distance from the speed limit sign to the hazard, this is a balance between
ensuring drivers can reduce speed prior to a hazard and not making that distance so long that
compliance becomes an issue.

Where it is unsafe for the buffer speed zones to be applied (e.g. unsealed roads) ‘speed limit
ahead’ signs must be used in place of the buffer speed zones (see AGTTM Part 3).

Signs installed within zones must be spaced in accordance with AGTTM.

A safety buffer must be provided in accordance with AGTTM.

#### 6.5.3 Selecting Temporary Speed Limits on State Roads

AS1742.3 specifies that “The temporary speed zone shall apply only while the relevant
conditions exist. It shall be removed as soon as practical after the need for its imposition
passes”. This typically means that if the speed limit has been implemented for road worker
safety, a higher speed limit will be required when road workers are not present.

AGTTM provides guidance on the conditions warranting temporary speed limits at road works.
The speed selected may impact on the efficiency of traffic flows and driver compliance at the
road work site.

Long Term Works

As a component of planning the works, traffic management must be designed with due
consideration to traffic efficiency and the amenity of road users and the community. For any
long term works on high volume State Roads, the minimum roadwork speed zone must be no
greater than 20 km/h below the posted speed limit and must be in accordance with Table 7.

```
High volume roads
Posted Speed Roadwork Speed
110 km/h ≥ 80 km/h
100 km/h ≥ 80 km/h
90 km/h ≥ 80 km/h(or 70 km/h)
80 km/h ≥ 60 km/h^
70 km/h ≥ 60 km/h(or 50 km/h)
60 km/h ≥ 40 km/h^
50 km/h ≥ 40 km/h
40 km/h ≥ 40 km/h
```
```
Table 7 : Minimum roadwork speed limits
```
When preparing a TMP the allowable traffic speed will be determined by various factors
including the distance of separation between workers and moving traffic. Site constraints will
often limit the available distance, which in turn necessitates the lowering of traffic speed limits.

Note: Where the temporary speed limit for a project is increased in order to comply with this
requirement, then all elements of the traffic management must be designed for the higher limit.
For example, the temporary speed limit may require a greater separation between workers
and traffic or the installation of an appropriate roadworks road safety barrier system.

Short Term Activities at Long Term Works

Within a long-term work project, it is accepted there will be short periods where speed limits
lower than Table 7 may be required to carry out unavoidable high-risk tasks. These
circumstances include, but are not limited to, activities such as setting out/ removing barriers,
setup/ takedown of traffic management or work vehicles exiting the worksite into free-flowing
traffic. In these circumstances, a temporarily reduced limit of 60 km/h or 40 km/h may be
warranted where the lower speed limit is only applied while the high-risk activity is taking place
(e.g. where unprotected workers are required to be within 3m of traffic).

Where the lower speed limit is needed often the use of electronic speed signs that can be
changed remotely should be considered.

It is not necessary to apply to Main Roads for a variation to standards in these circumstances
if efforts are made to ensure these temporary reductions are kept to a minimum and/or
conducted outside of peak periods wherever possible.

See section 4. 2 .3 if reducing traffic speeds to 40 km/h on high-speed high volume roads.

#### 6.5.4 Length of Temporary Speed Zones

The eighth (8th) dot point of section 5. 5 .1 of AGTTM Part 3 states ‘The length of the temporary
speed zone should be as shown in Table 5.5’.

In WA this must be replaced with:

The length of the temporary speed zone must be as shown in Table 5.5


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 51

### 6.6 TEMPORARY ROAD SAFETY BARRIER SYSTEMS

Section 5.3.1 of AGTTM Part 3 provides details on road safety barrier systems used at
temporary traffic management sites.

The use, selection and location of temporary barriers should be in accordance with the Main
Roads Guide to the Design of Workzone Barriers, located on the Main Roads website at
[http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au;](http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au;) go to ‘Technical & Commercial’ > ‘Road & Traffic Engineering’ >
‘Roadside Items’ > ‘Guide to the Design of Workzone Barriers’

Only Main Roads approved road safety barrier systems must be used; a list is located on the
Main Roads website at [http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au;](http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au;) go to Technical & Commercial’ > ‘Road &
Traffic Engineering’ > ‘Roadside Items’ > ‘Guide to the Design of Workzone Barriers’ ‘List of
Approved Road Safety Barrier Systems’

#### 6.6.1 Delineation of Temporary Road Safety Barriers

Temporary Road Safety Barriers help protect road workers and road users from hazards,
however the barriers themselves can also present a hazard to road users. Barriers must be
adequately delineated with raised retroreflective pavement markers (RRPMs) complying with
AS 1906.3 or temporary RRPMs (flaps) with retroreflective tape (class 1A minimum) to ensure
road users are aware of their presence.

The Pavement Markers providing delineation must be located on top of or on the traffic side of
the barriers (< 300mm from the top), spaced at ≤ 12 m intervals along the barrier. Where used
on curves with a radius up to 200 m the spacing must be reduced to 6 m on the outside of the
curve.

The retroreflector or tape may either be yellow double sided* on all barrier applications or the
following colours may be used:
a) Single sided red on barriers installed on the left-hand shoulder or verge.
b) Single sided yellow on barriers installed in the median of a divided road
c) Double sided yellow where the barrier is positioned in between opposing direction of
travel and delineator is placed on the top of the barrier
d) Single sided white on barriers installed between lanes in the same direction of travel
(rare scenario).
* The use of all yellow retroreflectors must be risk assessed prior to deployment, particularly
on 2 - way single carriageway applications.

Note: the above does not replace the need to provide temporary delineation of the travelled
path in accordance with AS1742.3. This temporary barrier delineation is considered a
replacement for guide post delineation where the location of the barrier is close enough to the
edge of the road.

Temporary Pavement Markers Material Specifications:

- Extrusion. Polyurethane, 80 shore A
- Cover. PVC Flexible. Clear.

For further details on specifications for the adhesive and reflectivity properties of the
Temporary Pavement Markers, see Main Roads Specification 60 4 , located on the Main Roads
website at [http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au;](http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au;) go to ’Technical & Commercial’ > ‘Tender Preparation’
> ‘Specifications’ > ‘600 Series – Traffic Facilities’


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 52

#### 6.6.2 Barrier Edge Clearances

The below minimum edge clearances are recommended as a variation to table 5.1 of AGTTM
Part 3.
Table 8 **–** Road Safety Barrier System Clearance to Traffic Lane

```
Speed (km/h) Distance (m)*
```
```
40 km/h or less 0.2
```
```
41 - 60 km/h 0.3
```
```
61 - 80 km/h 0.5
```
```
Greater than 80 km/h 1
```
The above reduced clearance does not apply to the leading edge of the barrier system, Table
5.1 of AGTTM Part 3 should apply. This will reduce the risk of errant vehicles colliding with the
end treatment of the barrier.

### 6.7 MINIMUM LANE WIDTHS

The below variation to the minimum lane widths in section 2.5.8 of AGTTM Part 3 and section
3.3.4 of AGTTM Part 2 may be applied (changes in red):

```

buses, trams)
Approach lane is < 3 m wide Equal to approach lane
Two-way residential street 5.5 (sum both ways)
Shuttle flow operation
Shuttle flow with traffic control 3.2
Shuttle flow on residential streets Maximum 3.5
```
Note: *This does not apply to curves of radius 250 m or less, or locations where there are fixed
vertical obstructions such as fences or safety barriers within 30 cm of the edge of the lane on
one or both sides. Where these conditions apply, consider widths wider than those listed
above to accommodate large vehicles.

Refer to AGTTM for other considerations e.g. cyclists, heavy vehicles, etc.

### 6.8 TRAFFIC CONTROL

The following must be read as a supplement to AGTTM Part 3 and Part 7. WA has not
adopted the method for estimating end of queue position or positioning of the PREPARE TO
STOP, Traffic Controller (Symbolic), Signals Ahead or Boom Barrier signs within section 4.8 of
AGTTM Part 3.

As per section 5.10 in AGTTM Part 3, Traffic control refers to all methods of traffic control
including by portable traffic control devices (e.g. portable traffic signals or boom barriers) or by
manual traffic controllers.

No form of traffic control is permitted on any Freeway or grade separated highways with:

- a permanent speed limit of 90 km/h or more; and
- a traffic volume of 20 ,000 vpd or more.

AGTTM Part 2: Traffic Management Planning indicates that inadequate vertical alignment is a
potential risk associated with accommodating truck traffic and over-sized loads. In particular,
the vertical alignment must be considered when proposing a location to stop vehicles as this
may impact both safety and level of service:

- Downgrade: steep downgrades increase the stopping distance of heavy vehicles which
    increases the risk of high severity end of queue collisions
- Upgrade: stopping heavy vehicles at locations with an upgrade may result in the
    stopped vehicle rolling back as well as impacting the time for the vehicle to accelerate
    from the stopped position.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 54

#### 6.8.1 Advanced Warning Signs

Where traffic may be required to stop due to traffic control, the PREPARE TO STOP sign must
be used in conjunction with the Traffic Controller (Symbolic), Signals Ahead or Boom Barrier
sign (depending on the method of traffic control). Where possible the signs should be
positioned side by side with the PREPARE TO STOP sign closest to the travel way.

The position of the PREPARE TO STOP sign and Traffic Controller (Symbolic), Signals Ahead
or Boom Barrier sign must be according to the local prevailing conditions, it is recommended
they be placed a minimum distance as shown in table 10 in advance of the Traffic Control
station.

MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 55

The STOP HERE ON RED SIGNAL or STOP HERE WHEN DIRECTED sign must be placed 6
m in advance of the PTCD/traffic controller position. A temporary STOP line must also be
considered at this location using temporary removable road marking tape. There should be
adequate distance between the PTCD/traffic controller position and the traffic control taper to
ensure it can be safely negotiated by all vehicles, considering swept paths of large vehicles.

Section 4.8 of AGTTM Part 3, recommends four cones be placed on the centreline from the
STOP HERE ON RED SIGNAL or STOP HERE WHEN DIRECTED sign position, which is
encouraged, however where supported by a site-specific risk assessment these cones may be
omitted.

It is recognised that there is often limited space on some local roads due to things such as
parked cars, footpaths, works occurring close to intersections, etc. The Worker (symbolic) and
Traffic Controller (symbolic) signs may be used in the same MMS panel where all the following
requirements are met:

- The road is a low-speed local road (permanent speed 60 km/h or below);
- There are site constraints which do not allow the signs to be separated;
- The signs are used with the MMS-ADV-26 PREPARE TO STOP sign;
- The Traffic Controller (symbolic) sign (MMS-ADV-47) must be positioned closest to the
    traffic;
- The signs must be duplicated on both sides of the road or carriageway;
- The signs must only be displayed when the need exists and removed or replaced when
    workers are not visible and/or there is no Traffic Controller requiring road users to stop.

#### 6.8.2 Avoiding End of Queue Collisions

Queueing and delay are an expected consequence when any roadworks require the use of
traffic control.
Before implementing any type of traffic control, it is the responsibility of the traffic management
designer to consider the following:

- The speed of traffic
- The road environment (e.g. horizontal and vertical curves, road surface, road grade^13 )
- The sight distance road users will have to the traffic control position
- Driver reaction times (general case assumption = 2.5 sec)
- The traffic volume (including determining the peak traffic volumes within the proposed
    work period)
- The traffic composition (e.g. large vehicles will require greater stopping sight distance)
- Work times and duration
- Expected time traffic will be stopped
- Worksite length (see section 6.8. 7 for maximum length of single lane section)
- Personnel available

(^13) Downgrades may require greater stopping sight distance.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 56

Once the traffic management designer has gained the above information the expected queue
length should^14 be predicted using the following steps:

1. Determine the hourly traffic volume in the direction of travel at the time of the works^15 ;
2. Divide the hourly traffic volume by 60 to determine the vehicles expected every minute;
3. Determine the length of time to the nearest minute that vehicles will be required to stop
    (this includes stop time for work reasons and clearance times);
4. Multiply this number by the vehicles expected per minute (i.e. vehicles per minute X
    number of minutes);
5. Determine the types of vehicles that will be using the road and multiply its length by the
    number (include a 3 m space between each vehicle):

```
Note: When determining expected queue length any decimals should be round up e.g. if it
calculated that 1.5 trucks will be stopped during the stopping time, this should be round up
to 2 trucks (i.e. there cannot be half a truck in the queue).
```
```

Triple Road Train / Large
Combination
```
```
53.5 m
```
```
Quad Road Train 60 m
```
End of Queue Protection

The PREPARE TO STOP sign must be placed a minimum distance as shown in table 12 in
advance of the end of the queue when the permanent posted speed is greater than 70 km/h or
the sight distance of approaching traffic to the end of the queue is:

- less than two times the speed limit in open road areas
- less than 1.5 times the speed limit in built-up areas.

It is important to ensure adequate Stopping Sight Distance is provided to the PREPARE TO
STOP sign and the end of queue. This is the distance required to allow a driver to react and
stop their vehicle, this distance will generally be the distance shown in table 12 however if
there are downgrades, large vehicles, poor surface condition, etc. the stopping distance will
exceed these distances (for more details on Stopping Sight Distance see Austroads Guide to
Road Design Part 3).

(^14) Refer to the Main Roads Fact Sheet _–_ Avoiding end of queue collisions for an alternative method.
(^15) Traffic volumes can be provided by the relevant road authority. Where no traffic volumes are available
the person preparing the plan should attend the site and count vehicles for a 5 minute period. Note that
growth rates need to be considered when using data older than 12 months.

```
Diagram notes:

- The diagrams do not depict speed reduction and advanced warning signage which
    must be included (see table 2.2 of AGTTM Part 3 for sign spacing).
- The additional PREPARE TO STOP sign should be installed a distance provided in
    table 1 2 from the end of the queue.
- It is recommended the PREPARE TO STOP sign T1-18B or Queued Traffic ahead
    multi-message sign (MMS-ADV-90, MMS-ADV-91, MMS-ADV-26) is used in advance
    of the end of queue.
- Provide PREPARE TO STOP and symbolic warning sign in advance of the control
    point a distance shown in table 10.
- Sight distance to the end of queue should be a minimum distance provided in table 1 2
    from the predicted end of queue for the peak period.
- a Marker (e.g. cone or bollard) may be placed on the shoulder at the predicted end of
    queue to assist in monitoring the queue lengths (figure 4).
- Where the queue is expected to be more than the distance provided in table 1 3

#### 6.8.3 Portable Traffic Control Devices

As indicated in AGTTM portable traffic control devices (PTCD) are the preferred method to
control traffic.

PTCDs must be used as the method of traffic control, for the following roads:

- any road that is under the control of Main Roads*; OR
- any road not controlled by Main Roads with
    o a permanent speed limit of 90 km/h or more and over 2,000 vpd*; OR
    o a permanent speed limit of 70 km/h or more and over 10,000 vpd*.

*refer to exceptions listed below.

Works on roads outside of the above should still consider the use of PTCDs and they may still
be required based on a risk assessment. Traffic management planners should also refer to
contractual requirements that may require the use of PTCDs regardless of the speed and/or
traffic volume.

Traffic control with stop-slow bats may be permitted in the below circumstances:

- At permanent traffic signals based on a risk assessment^16
- Where the total cumulative time of the stop-slow activity over a 24-hour period is 5
    minutes or less based on a risk assessment
- activities 5 to 15 minutes at a single location* based on a documented risk assessment
    with the following:
       o a site specific TMP, OR
       o a TGS (within an authorised TMP) determined to be site suitable by a person
          with WTM/AWTM accreditation
- Stop slow permitted for TTM set up and pack up, e.g. holding traffic to set up the signal
    or implementing a lateral shift on a 2 lane 2-way road
- Emergency and Incident Management
- In the event of failure of the PTCDs (the PTCD must be repaired or replaced in a timely
    manner)

*may be multiple work locations

Any use of PTCDs, or other traffic control, to be within an authorised TMP prepared in
accordance with section 4.2.

Where there are other roadside features that prevent a PTCD from being used these are to be
identified and mitigated where possible, with a TC only being used if an RTM has risk
assessed and endorsed the variation for Road authority endorsement (see section 4.5).

Refer to section 2.6.2 of AGTTM Part 7 for key considerations for determining a safe location
for traffic controllers when using a PTCD. This location should be identified on the TGS.
PTCDs primary benefit is separating the traffic controller from direct interaction with traffic.
Generally, the traffic controller location should be a minimum of 3 m from the traffic lane.

(^16) The use of portable traffic signals at permanent traffic signals may cause confusion to road users,
however boom barriers must be considered.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 59

The below examples have been provided to assist in determining the need for PTCDs based
on the duration of traffic control (other noted exceptions may apply):

Note: all use of PTCDs, or other traffic control, must be within an authorised TMP prepared in
accordance with section 4.2.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 60

A risk assessment must be conducted prior to considering the use of PTCD. This should
examine duration of operation (set up time risk), what would happen in the event of failure
assessing available sight distances, traffic volumes and traffic speeds. Mitigating factors must
include regular inspections and having back up traffic controllers. Wherever back up traffic
controllers are provided they must be positioned in a safe but prominent location to ensure
drivers are aware that compliance with the PTCD is being observed.

PTCDs are only permitted to control a single lane of traffic, when traffic control is required on
multilane roads, merge/s should be introduced in advance so the PTCD is only managing one
lane, or temporary fixed traffic signals must be installed where controlling multiple lanes of
traffic.

PTCDs must be either:

- a portable traffic signal that complies with AS4191, or
- a PTCD that has been approved for use by Main Roads.

PTCD options include portable traffic signal systems (PTSS) and portable boom barriers. Both
types of PTCDs have advantages and disadvantages. A combination of a boom barrier and
traffic signal is likely to the best method for controlling traffic, i.e. motorists are more
accustomed to traffic signals, the traffic signal aspect is more visible, and the boom barrier
provides a physical barrier to prevent motorists running the red light. It is expected, in the near
future, the use of a boom barrier and traffic signal combination will be recommended under
certain conditions when stopping traffic at temporary traffic management sites, e.g., traffic
speed, traffic volume, duration of works, etc.

#### 6.8.4 Traffic Controllers

Traffic Controllers are primarily used to manage, control and stop traffic where other signs and
devices are considered insufficient. Accredited Traffic Controllers (see section 8) are required
to operate in compliance with AGTTM Part 7: Traffic Controllers.

Section 2.9.7 of AGTTM Part 7 includes methods for Traffic Controllers to control multiple
lanes of traffic on multilane roads. This practice is not supported in Western Australia. When
traffic control is required on multilane roads, a merge or merges must be introduced in
advance of the traffic control position so that only one lane of traffic is being controlled by the
Traffic Controller.

#### 6.8.5 Stop-Slow Bats

When using a Stop-Slow bat to control traffic the B size, 600 mm diameter, STOP/SLOW face
should be used unless the use of the A size, 450 mm diameter, STOP/SLOW face is
supported by a risk assessment e.g. due to windy conditions.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 61

#### 6.8.6 Portable Boom Barriers

Portable Boom barriers are a PTCD option that must be operated in accordance with all
requirements within AGTTM, AS1742.3 and this Code. The following must also be considered
when using a boom barrier:

- It is recommended that there is one traffic controller used per boom barrier. In cases
    where one traffic controller is operating more than one boom barrier this needs to be
    adequately justified, and a thorough risk assessment conducted by a person with
    AWTM accreditation. The traffic controllers must be within 75 m of the boom barrier
    and have an unobstructed line of sight to oncoming traffic and the boom barriers being
    operated.

A STOP sign (R6-8B) must be mounted on the boom barrier and the boom barrier stripes must
have alternative red and white stripes in accordance with Australian Standard 1742.7.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 62

#### 6.8.7 Shuttle flow

The below variation to the maximum permitted length of single lane shuttle within AGTTM Part
2 and 3 may be applied (changes in red):

### Table 15 : Maximum length of operation under shuttle flow

### Total volume in both directions (vph) Length of single lane section (m)

### Residential street 60

### 701 - 800 70

### 601 - 700 100

### 501 - 600 150

### 401 - 500 250

### 351 - 400 400

### 301 - 350 600

### 251 - 300 800

### 201 - 250 1200

### 151 - 200 1600

### ≤150 2200

NOTE: Lengths to be taken as the distance between the STOP HERE ON RED SIGNAL or
STOP HERE WHEN DIRECTED sign positions for each direction.

Shuttle lengths exceeding the lengths provided within AGTTM must be based on a risk
assessment to the satisfaction of the relevant road authority. The risk assessment must
consider stopping time, queue length, clearance time, number of worksites along the route,
heavy vehicle composition, road geometry and road user compliance. Use of a roadworks pilot
vehicle should be considered.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 63

#### 6.8.8 Roadworks Pilot Vehicles

A roadwork pilot vehicle, consistent with the requirements of AGTTM Part 3, should be
considered on all Main Roads’ roads where all the following conditions apply, unless otherwise
supported by a risk assessment:

- the closure of one or more lanes that necessitates the use of a shuttle flow with use of
    a PTCD or traffic controller; and
- the travel path for vehicles is not clearly delineated for the full length of the lane closure
    with cones, bollards or similar.*

Further to all the above conditions, a roadwork pilot vehicle must be utilised when all the
above apply as well as all the following conditions applying:

- the length of the shuttle flow is greater than 500 m; and
- the traffic volume of the road is greater than 500 vehicles / day (AADT).

The roadworks pilot vehicle driver must have a current driver’s licence, BWTM accreditation
and be competent to perform roadwork pilot vehicle driver duties.

NOTE: This task is separate to and different from the requirements for pilot vehicles for heavy
vehicles in general traffic situations.

*At a minimum delineation with cones, bollards, temporary hazard markers, or similar must be
provided at a maximum spacing of 60 m.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 64

#### 6.8.9 Traffic Control Near Intersections

When undertaking any form of Traffic Control the following will be considered two traffic
approaches:

- Traffic entering from the side road^17 will enter the lane being controlled by a Traffic
    Controller and/or Portable Traffic Control Device (PTCD); and
- The centreline of the side road is within 30 m of the position of the STOP HERE WHEN
    DIRECTED or STOP HERE ON RED SIGNAL sign on the through road.

A single traffic controller must never control more than one traffic approach, therefor when
both of the above will be met an additional Traffic Controller and/or PTCD must be positioned
on the side road to control traffic entering the through road.

See figure 6 below, a Traffic Controller or PTCD must be positioned on the side road where
traffic entering from the through road will be required to stop within the red boxed area.

```
Figure 6 : Traffic control near a side road
```
All other side roads within the worksite must be risk assessed to determine if traffic entering
the through road needs to be controlled by a traffic controller or PTCD.

(^17) Side road includes accesses to shopping centres, service stations, etc.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 65

### 6.9 TRUCK MOUNTED ATTENUATORS

A truck mounted attenuator (TMA) is a combination of Host Vehicle with a mounted Crash
Attenuator to protect road workers.

Trailer Mounted Attenuators are not permitted in WA.

The Requirements for the use of Truck Mounted Attenuators (TMAs) in WA – Code of Practice
(TMA Code of Practice) have been adopted as a minimum requirement in WA (refer to the
TMA Code of Practice for Host Vehicle requirements and TMA Deployment example
diagrams). A copy is available on the Main Roads website at [http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au;](http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au;) go to
‘Technical & Commercial’ > ‘Working on roads’.

Example Diagrams
Diagrams in Appendix 6 have been included to provide guidance when preparing TMPs
involving the use of TMAs for the following situations:

Diagram 1
TMA Deployment in Emergency Lane or Verge. Multilane one-way carriageway.
Diagram 2
TMA Deployment in shoulder or verge. Two-lane two-way road.

#### 6.9.1 Mandatory use of TMAs

This section details the roads and localities where TMAs must be used to protect the work
area. TMAs are not required if the work area has been separated or protected by a full road
closure or a road safety barrier.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 66

6. 9. 1. 1 F r e e w a y s a n d H i g h S p e e d R o a d s

A TL-3 TMA must be used for any works on or within 3 m of a traffic lane on roads
detailed in the below table:

```

Blocker Vehicle
There have been instances where vehicles have entered a worksite via the emergency lane or
shoulder. As a result, to prevent vehicles entering the work area from the off-road side when
only closing a single traffic lane, a blocker vehicle with TMA must be used at static worksites
that meet the following:

- Work occurs on a Freeway; and
- Work area is within a traffic lane; and
- Work area is not separated or protected by a full road closure or road safety barrier.

(Refer to diagram 5 of Appendix 6 ).

Note: A blocker vehicle is not required, subject to a risk assessment, where the
shoulder/emergency lane is 2 m wide or less from a road safety barrier.

A blocker vehicle is not required when closing more than one lane of traffic for the following
reasons: increased advanced warning, increased available stopping distance to the work area
and reduced travel speed of road users (Refer to diagrams 4 and 6 of Appendix 6 )

It is also recommended to use a second blocker vehicle (does not have to be TMA) adjacent to
the worksite to prevent worksite intrusion by errant vehicles on the roadside (Refer to diagram
7 of Appendix 6 ).

At other locations a risk assessment must be conducted to determine if a vehicle entering the
work area is a significant risk.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 67

6. 9 .1. 2 O t h e r H i g h V o l u m e S t a t e R o a d s

A TMA must be used for works in the traffic lane on:

#### 6.9.2 Other use of TMAs

In addition to the mandatory requirements for the use of TMAs as prescribed above
consideration must be given to the use of TMAs when all the criteria described below exist at a
work site:

- The work area occupies the traffic lane; and
- The work area will not be separated or protected by a full road closure or road safety
    barrier; and
- The posted speed limit prior to road works is 100 km/h or more; and
- The road is a multilane road.

TMAs may be used at other locations than those detailed above, it is important to note if using
a TMA on 2 lane 2 way roads the display of the arrow on the illuminated flashing arrow sign is
likely not appropriate, as traffic is likely to need to seek a gap in oncoming traffic to safely
pass. Where the arrow cannot be displayed, either the bar of the arrow only or the four corner
lights at the extremities of the barbs must be flashed (refer AS1742.3).

Refer to section 8.7 for TMA operator training requirements.

#### 6.9.3 Incident Response and Emergency Works

When responding to incidents and/or emergencies there are many different risks to consider
compared with planned works. It is recognised that it will generally not be possible to set up
the site to be fully compliant with temporary traffic management requirements, including the
use of TMAs where required.

Emergency Management Agencies (and their approved contractors when undertaking these
tasks) should consider the following when responding to incidents at locations where a TMA is
required:

- The risk posed by the incident if left untreated, i.e. is taking no action deemed a higher
    risk than if action is taken
- The timeframe to have a TMA or IPPV on site
- The speed of traffic, e.g. has the traffic speed been significantly reduced due to the
    incident (or general traffic congestion)
- The part of the roadway where the incident has occurred, e.g. will there be an escape
    path for workers
- The traffic volume at the time of the incident, e.g. will there be sufficient gaps in traffic
    for workers to treat the incident
- The use of a lookout person to warn workers of oncoming vehicles
- Is the vehicle fitted with a flashing arrow sign, to provide warning to oncoming vehicles
    and shadow the workers
- Can Variable Message Signs (VMS), the Lane Use Management System (LUMS)
    and/or other ITS solutions be utilised to warn and/or control motorists.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 70

### 6.10 ILLUMINATED FLASHING ARROW SIGN

The primary illuminated flashing arrow signs should be used as follows:

```
Table 1 8 – Illuminated flashing arrow sign size
```
```
Circumstance Size
Lane closures or mobile works on roads
with a permanent speed of 60 km/h or less
```
```
Size A

Lane closures or mobile works on roads
with a permanent speed of 70 km/h or
more
```
```
Size B

```
```
Lane closures or mobile works on:
```
- Any freeway; or
- multilane roads with a speed of 90
    km/h or more and 15,000 vpd or
    more; or
- where a high level of long-distance
    advance warning is desirable for
    safety

```
Size C
2400 x 1200 mm
```
Note: the above does not apply to vehicle mounted warning devices on support / work
vehicles.

The lamps used on the vehicle mounted warning device should meet the requirements of the
Society for Automotive Engineers (SAE) Class 1 warning lights (i.e. be at least 8100 candela).


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 71

### 6.11 TRAFFIC VOLUME

AGTTM Part 2 Traffic Management Planning (table 3.1) and Part 3 Static Worksites (table 2. 4 )
provide details on the number of traffic lanes to be provided, these requirements are accepted
in WA, the below table applies if varying from the desirable number of open lanes required in
AGTTM. Approval for any variation to the traffic volume requirements detailed in AGTTM must
be obtained from the relevant Road Infrastructure Manager.

opposing traffic is high. Seek further assistance if needed.
** As per AGTTM ‘The word intersection applies where traffic in the considered direction is
controlled by signals, a roundabout, stop/give way controls or other control devices.’

The traffic volumes shown in the table may need to be reduced under certain conditions as
described below (taken direct from AGTTM for clarity):

- Reduced by 30% if the pavement surface is rough or unsealed.
- Reduced by 50% if the horizontal geometry through the work site is reduced to a speed
    value of less than 40 km/h.
- Reduced by 20% if the volume of heavy vehicles exceeds 10% and the road is
    downward, level or easy upgrade.
- Reduced by 40% if the volume of heavy vehicles exceeds 10% and the road has
    sustained upgrade > 5%.

Traffic Volumes on Freeways and Grade Separated Motorways

Roads with grade separation generally allow traffic to move more freely with fewer
interruptions, therefor the below table may be used when determining the number of lanes to
be provided. This table recognises that limiting the speed reductions on these roads may allow
for a greater volume of traffic.

```

MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 72

Figure 7 : Entry Ramp **–** desirable traffic volume within 200 m up and downstream of
the start of the continuity line or lane line

Table 20 can be used for short-term works and as a guide to long-term works. Where these
maximum volumes are present at long-term work sites there will be a need to precisely
calculate capacity to ensure that traffic demand can be met. Site-specific calculations are
needed to show the relationship between traffic density and the ability of motorists to maintain
speed. Site-specific variables need to be considered in the calculations such as lane width,
alignment, surface condition and heavy vehicle mix etc. In part, this assessment is necessary
to ensure traffic speed through the site is not constrained through the sheer traffic volume or.

### 6.12 MOBILE WORKS

```
Austroads Guide to Temporary Traffic Management Part 4: Mobile Works is adopted in WA
with the following departures:
```
```
Table 21 – Mobile works AGTTM departures
```
AGTTM
Section

```
Departure / Clarification
```
3.5.1 Lead
Vehicle

```
A lead vehicle is:
```
- Required when the line marking machine is painting the dividing line; or
- Required when workers are on foot in a lane adjacent to oncoming traffic
    e.g. working in the lane on 2 - way 2 lane undivided roads.
The lead vehicle may be omitted:
- On roads with a speed limit of 60 km/h or less, based on a risk
assessment, e.g. if the convoy is determined to be too long for safe
overtaking, or
- When the work vehicle is in the lane adjacent to oncoming traffic with no
workers on foot*

```
*A lead vehicle must be considered, based on a risk assessment, if the work
vehicle meets any one of the following:
```
- Does not have an enclosed cab; or
- Is conditionally licenced; or
- Has a mass less than 4 tonne.

3.5.3
Shadow
Vehicle

```
A shadow vehicle is required in all mobile work convoys in the traffic lane –
excludes shoulder grading (except where a risk assessment determines that the
use of a shadow vehicle is required to adequately reduce the risk).
```
```
For line marking activities on rural roads, the distance between the shadow
vehicle and work vehicle may be increased to ensure adequate sight distance for
approaching vehicles e.g., over a crest or around a bend. This must be based on
a risk assessment and the shadow vehicle must always provide protection to the
work vehicle.
```
```
Truck Mounted Attenuators
TMAs are only required at mobile works on:
```
- Roads with a speed limit of 80 km/h or more and 3,000 vpd or more; or
- When conducting longitudinal road marking on State Roads with a speed
    limit 80km/h or more; or
- Any other road based on a risk assessment.

3.5.4
Advance
Warning
Vehicle

```
As well as stopping for curved sections of road or where visibility is restricted,
the advanced warning vehicle may remain stationary on the verge or shoulder at
locations where there is limited shoulder or verge for the vehicle to continuously
travel along e.g., due to culverts, roadside furniture, trees, steep batters, bridges,
etc.
```
```
The Advance Warning Vehicle does not have to be constantly moving with the
convoy, as long as the general principle of it providing advanced warning to
motorists is met.
```
```
This must be based on risk assessment. The maximum spacing between the
advanced warning vehicle and shadow vehicle must be included in the TMP and
risk assessment.
```

MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 74

### 6.13 SHADOW VEHICLE

For mobile works, AGTTM Part 4 requires a shadow vehicle to provide close protection to the
rear of workers on foot. A shadow vehicle should also be considered at static worksites when
workers on foot are in close proximity to traffic e.g. to protect workers within 3 m of live traffic.

Shadow vehicles must be used to protect workers on foot (when not protected by Road Safety

```
Notes:

1. Refer to the Requirements for the Use of TMAs in WA Code of Practice for when a TMA must be used to
    protect workers.
2. Workers on foot includes traffic management workers implementing/removing traffic management
3. For works at single lane shuttle flow, the shadow vehicle should be protecting workers from the direction of
    traffic flow in the closed lane.
4. A lookout person may be omitted when monitoring traffic management e.g. picking up fallen signs, based
    on a risk assessment when there are adequate gaps in traffic.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 75

The use and location of the shadow vehicle must be outlined in the TMP and TGS, the shadow
vehicle must be within a reasonable proximity to workers. This should be based on a risk
assessment considering the following:

- likelihood of an errant vehicle impacting the workers
- vehicles entering from nearby intersections that could enter the closed lane
- horizontal and vertical curves near workers
- confusing roadworks layout
- road surface
- proximity of workers to the travel way
- use of a lookout person
- use of a pilot vehicle

Where the ‘active’ works is not in close proximity of the start of the lane closure, i.e. where
sight distance and sight line requirements cannot be maintained, an additional illuminated
flashing arrow sign is required to assist road users in manoeuvring past the taper.

Where the shadow vehicle is a TMA, the additional illuminated flashing arrow sign at the start
of the lane closure is not required to be a TMA, this must be based on a risk assessment.

The below figures illustrate examples of using shadow vehicles to protect workers.

Figure 8 : Shadow vehicle scenario 1 **–** Works in traffic lane on road with two lanes in
one direction.

### 6.14 TTM IMPLEMENTATION, OPERATION AND REMOVAL

AGTTM Part 6: Field Staff – Implementation and Removal provides requirements for installing
and removing TTM schemes. AGTTM indicates the preferred method for implementing or
removing TTM schemes is to use the TTM vehicle to shadow^18 the TM workers and
install/remove signs and devices on one side of the road at a time:

```
Figure 1 4 : TTM implementation example from AGTTM Part 6 (figure 6.1)
```
Crossing the road should be avoided where possible and where it is undertaken a look out
person/spotter must be used for all activities where required in accordance with AGTTM Part
5.

WA has the below additions to the requirements within AGTTM when implementing,
monitoring or removing TTM schemes:

6.14.1 High Speed Multilane Roads

Crossing the road is not permitted on any road where a Truck Mounted Attenuator is required
to protect workers, see the Requirements for the Use of Truck Mounted Attenuators in WA –
Code of Practice.

(^18) See section 6.13 for Shadow Vehicle requirements.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 78

6.14.2 Main Roads Controlled Roads

As per section 6.13, crossing the road to implement/remove signs is not permitted on Main
Roads roads with the following traffic volumes:

- All work on roads with traffic volumes that exceed 15,000 vpd (AADT); OR
- Night works on roads that exceed 2,000 vpd (AADT)

Crossing these roads is only permitted when supported by a documented risk assessment
undertaken by:

- a AWTM as part of the TMP; or
- an onsite documented risk assessment undertaken by a person that holds at least
    WTM accreditation.

If a risk assessment supports crossing the road a dedicated lookout person must be used (a
lookout person may be omitted when monitoring traffic management e.g. picking up fallen
signs, based on a risk assessment when there are adequate gaps in traffic).

### 6.15 TRAFFIC CONES AND BOLLARDS

The first dot point of section 5.4.1 of AGTTM Part 3 states ‘Maximum spacing of cones and
bollards must be as shown in Table 5.3.’

In WA this should be replaced with:

- Maximum spacing of cones and bollards should be as shown in Table 5.3.

### 6.16 SPEED FEEDBACK SIGNS

Speed feedback signs (also referred to as speed radar signs, speed LED signs, Vehicle
Activated Signs, Speed Indication Devices or speed radar VMS) detect vehicle speeds (using
laser speed-detection equipment, for example) and currently the speed and/or a message
(e.g. SLOW DOWN) is displayed on an electronic sign. The primary purpose is to make drivers
aware of their speed and encourage them to reduce their speed through the worksite.
Research indicates that these are very effective in reducing drivers speed for short term
purposes.

Speeds above the speed limit must not be displayed on the sign, i.e. just a message, such as
SLOW DOWN, should be shown.

Speed feedback signs must be used at static worksites on Main Roads’ roads when all the
following apply:

- Traffic is travelling past or through the worksite (as defined in AGTTM Part 3)
- Workers on foot are not protected by a road safety barrier; and
- Works conducted at the location for a duration of 8 hours or more; and
- Traffic volume of 15,000 vpd (AADT) or more; and
- There is a temporary speed reduction of 30 km/h or more

Above does not apply when there are more than 2 lanes of traffic open in a single direction
where speed feedback signs are not recommended.

The speed feedback display does not have to be displayed at all times e.g. the display may be
turned off and the device used to gather speed data when trialling other speed control
measures.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 79

Speed feedback signs may be used at other locations to encourage motorists to reduce speed
and/or to collect speed data.

The speed feedback sign must be included in the TGS.

The speed feedback sign may display the temporary speed limit to confirm and remind road
users of the speed limit (i.e. as a repeater sign).

Technical Requirements:
Speed feedback signs should meet the following requirements:

- Have a display area of at least 430 mm x 430 mm
- Be positioned within or just in advance of the work area
- Be positioned at least 30 m or the distance as shown in table 2.2 of AGTTM Part 3,
    whichever is greater, from traffic signals, so as not to cause motorist confusion
- The lower edge of the sign be a minimum of 1 m above the level of the nearest lane
- The display and optical requirements in accordance with AS 4852.2: 2019 Variable
    message signs Part 2: Portable signs.
- Be calibrated to specified tolerances in accordance with manufacturer specifications
    and calibrated at intervals specified by the manufacturer.
- Have the ability to display speed and message for a minimum period of five seconds
- Have a minimum 100 metre detection range and the ability to display a message every
    three seconds
- Have the ability to obtain speed data and prepare reports using proprietary software for
    export to Excel compatible file

### 6.17 APPROACH TAPERS

#### 6.17.1 Designing Tapers

Refer to section 5.9.1 of AGTTM Part 3 for requirements for tapers.

When designing tapers points of conflict must be separated, as shown in the below figure from
Austroads Guide to Traffic Management.

In the subsection ‘Designing a taper **’** replace the fifth and sixth dot points:

- ‘Tapers must not start or end within 50 m of an intersection on Category 2 roads. In this
    case, the start of the taper is the point where the shift/merge finishes, and the end of
    the taper is where closed lanes are re-opened.
- Tapers must not start or end within 100 m of an intersection or on/off-ramp on Category
    3 roads. In this case, the start of the taper is the point where the shift/merge finishes,
    and the end of the taper is where closed lanes are re-opened.

With:

- Merge tapers must not start or end:
    - within 50 m of an intersection (both approach and departure sides) on a controlled
       leg of an intersection on a Category 2 road,
    - within 100 m of an intersection (both approach and departure side) located on a
       ramp from / to a Category 3 road, or
    - within 100 m of a ramp (on or off) on a Category 3 road.
- Merge tapers located on an uncontrolled leg of an intersection on a Category 2 road
    should not start or end within 50 m of the intersection (both approach and departure
    sides).
- Merge tapers must not be implemented through / across an intersection or ramp.

Replace the 7 th dot point:

- The length of taper depends on vehicle speeds as shown in Table 5.7. In determining
    the length of the taper, the speed selected is based on the process outlined in Figure
    2.2 to ensure that vehicles have adequate time to slow after passing a speed limit sign.

With:

- The length of taper depends on vehicle speeds as shown in Table 5.7. In determining
    the length of the taper, the speed selected must be based on the process outlined in
    figure 2.2 to ensure that vehicles have adequate time to slow after passing a speed
    limit sign.
- Where site constraints, or a site-specific hazard, requires a speed reduction to
    accommodate reduced taper lengths this must be justified and supported in a variation
    to standard undertaken by an RTM.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 81

#### 6.17.2 Tapers at Long Term Works

Lateral shifts or merge tapers have the potential for upstream congestion due to cautionary
braking. For this reason, the taper lengths specified in Table 5.7 of AGTTM Part 3 are to be
increased at long term works on high volume State Roads with a roadwork speed limit ≥ 80
km/h. Lateral shift tapers should not be less than 1:40 and merge tapers no less than 1:50.
For example, a lane requiring a 3.2m lateral shift will require a taper length of at least 128m
and 3.2m wide merged lanes will require a merge taper of at least 160m.

#### Merges at Entry Ramps

Austroads Guide to Road Design Part 4C requires the following when traffic enters a major
road from an entry ramp:

- Mutual visibility between the driver on the major road and a driver on the entry ramp.
    o Minimum of 4 seconds of travel at respective operating speeds prior to point
       where merging lanes are separated by 1 m (1.1 m eye height)
- Parallel section to provide road users an opportunity to merge after reaching the major
    road speed.
       o Minimum of 4 seconds of travel time.
- Merge taper.
    o Minimum 0.6 m/s lateral shift.
- Run-out area to accommodate those vehicles prevented from merging as they
    approach the narrowed section.
       o Maintaining a total pavement width in the direction of travel equal to at least the
          sum of the full lane width plus a sealed shoulder width of 2.0 m over the full
          length of the taper plus a 3.0 m shoulder for a distance of at least 30 m beyond
          the end.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 82

### Table 25 : Minimum entry ramp merging lengths (variation approval required)

(^1) The full length of the parallel section must allow drivers to legally change lanes on to the
major road (i.e. separated by lane or continuity lines).
(^2) Run-out area distance beyond the end of the merge taper.
The following must be considered when applying the minimum distances:

- Staging the works so that the reduced distances are only provided during the early
    stages of the works and installed for as short a duration as possible.
- Providing lane change pavement arrows

The design of entry merges at long-term works must be undertaken by either:

- A specialist road designer in consultation with an RTM; or
- Endorsed by an RTM proficient in Road Design Principles, Austroads Guide to Road
    Design and Main Roads WA Road Design Guidelines.

### 6.18 EMERGENCY LANES AND VEHICLE BREAKDOWNS

If long-term works on high volume State Roads remove the emergency lane for the purposes
of the works and/or long term works on a Freeway, the following must be provided to reduce
the likelihood of congestion if incidents or breakdowns occur and to ensure the safety of road
users:

- stopping bays must be provided every 500 m for the duration of the works; and
- a dedicated tow truck must be arranged by the contractor (assessment of the operating
    hours for tow truck should be coordinated by Main Roads Road Planned Interventions).

### 6.19 SMART FREEWAYS

Where works are planned on the Smart Freeway sections of the freeway, those planning the
works are to contact Road Planned Interventions for guidance prior to the preparation of the
TMP (e.g. how to incorporate the Lane Use Management Signs).

Smart Freeway:

- Kwinana Freeway northbound from Farrington Road to the Narrows Bridge; or
- Mitchell Freeway southbound from Hester Ave to Vincent St.

Details regarding the proposed works are to be sent to enquiries@mainroads.wa.gov.au

### 6.20 WORKSITE ACCESS

Requirements for the entry and exit to the worksite at long term works on high speed high
volume State Roads are as follows:

- A diverge transition must be provided to allow work vehicles to leave the traffic stream
    before entering the worksite.
- Merge sight distance to the diverge and merge points must be provided, where
    practical avoid placing access points on curves.
- The diverge and access points must be clearly defined for all approaching vehicles that
    is clearly signed and delineated.
- Where practical, site access points should be placed at on or off ramps to reduce
    safety and network performance risks.
- A deceleration zone prior to the access point for work vehicles entering the worksite
    must be provided, as a minimum the deceleration zone must be based on a speed of at
    least 20 km/h below the posted speed (e.g. 60 km/h in an 80 km/h speed zone).
- An acceleration zone for work vehicles exiting the worksite must be provided.
- Mutual visibility between drivers on the freeway and the work vehicles entering the
    freeway should be provided. This should be a minimum of 4 seconds of travel at
    respective operating speeds prior to the point where the work vehicle will enter the
    freeway.
- The design of access points should be based on the size and weight of the vehicles
    accessing the worksite (as per Austroads Guide to Road Design) or additional special
    access points should be provided.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 84

## 7. BEST PRACTICE

Main Roads encourages the use of the following Traffic Management devices that increase the
levels of safety, compliance and/or road user satisfaction at worksites.

### 7.1 INNOVATIVE TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES

When new innovative traffic control products emerge in the market there is a need for Main
Roads to review and approve these devices before they are used to ensure they will be safe
and effective. In July 2022 the Austroads Innovative Temporary Traffic Management Device
and Solution Assessment (AITDSA) Scheme was launched, see information on the Austroads
website: Austroads Innovative Temporary Traffic Management Device and Solution
Assessment (AITDSA) Scheme | Austroads

This scheme provides a way for all emerging TTM devices to be assessed and recommended
for use across Australia and New Zealand.

Main Roads (along with all other state and territory transport agencies) is a member of the
AITDSA Panel and expects all new TTM devices to be assessed through this scheme.

A list of recently approved devices and associated guidelines for use can be found on the Main
Roads website, go to [http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au](http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au) > ‘Technical & Commercial > ‘Working on
roads’.

### 7.2 ELECTRONIC SPEED LIMIT SIGNS

The Road Traffic Code 2000 allows for the use of electronic speed limit signs.

The use of these on roadworks sites is encouraged, particularly in situations where: there are
frequent changes in speed limits required as a part of the works OR it is hazardous to
manually change speed limits OR the works are of a long-term nature.

When using electronic speed limit signs; accurate time stamped records on exactly when the
speed limits have been changed must be kept. The usual sign inspection regime must be
adhered to and back up devices made available to enable prompt replacement of faulty
electronic signs.

Refer to AS 5156: 2020 Electronic speed limit signs.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 85

### 7.3 TRAFFIC MONITORING AND SURVEILLANCE

The use of Body Cameras, Dash Cameras or other video surveillance is encouraged at
temporary traffic management sites for the purposes of any of the following:

- Recording traffic incidents
- Recording traffic management inspections
- Site records
- Traffic monitoring
- As a deterrent or to record motorist non-compliance and/or aggressive behaviour.

Please note that anyone that conducts any form of video surveillance must ensure they are
following all applicable surveillance and privacy laws. If you are in any doubt as to the legal
requirements of the use of such devices, you should seek independent legal advice prior to
their use.

The Monitoring Camera (MMS-ADV-83) sign should be used when using body cameras or
other video surveillance as a deterrent or to record motorist non-compliance and/or aggressive
behaviour.

##### MMS-ADV- 83

### 7.4 RUMBLE STRIPS

As indicated in section 5.5.3 of AGTTM Part 3, rumble strips can be used on the approach to
temporary traffic management sites to make road users aware of the reduced speed limit and
influence them to decrease speed.

Temporary portable rumble strips are generally the type of rumble strip used at worksites
(refer to Main Roads Guideline Temporary Rumble Strips); however for longer term works the
use of thermoplastic strips, typically used for permanent hazards, may be utilised in
accordance with the Main Roads Policy Application Approval & Technical Guidelines - Rumble
Strips (www.mainroads.wa.gov.au > Technical & Commercial > Technical Library > Road and
Traffic Engineering > Traffic Management)

Any use of thermoplastic on the road surface must have the approval of the relevant road
infrastructure manager, and the pavement must be repaired to their satisfaction (typically
resurfacing will be required).

Any party intending to conduct works that may impact on traffic within any road reserve must,
as a condition of approval by Main Roads, local government or any other authority responsible
for the road, ensure that the persons performing the tasks contained in Table 26 hold a
relevant and current certificate of accreditation.

A Main Roads certificate is issued for each category of accreditation to individuals who
successfully meet the pre-requisites applicable for each level of accreditation. Accreditation
certificates are only permitted to be issued by Main Roads approved training providers.
Contact details for Main Roads approved training providers are listed on the Main Roads
website at [http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au;](http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au;) go to ‘Technical & Commercial’ > ‘Working on roads’ >
‘Training and Accreditation’.

See section 1.3.2 for details on the Austroads Training Framework.

### 8.2 TRAFFIC CONTROLLER ACCREDITATION

A Main Roads Traffic Controller accreditation certificate will be issued to those meeting the
following pre-requisites:

- an Australian Qualifications Framework compliant Statement of Attainment in the
    Resources and Infrastructure Industry Training Package Unit of Competency
    RIIWHS205E – Control traffic with a stop-slow bat, or equivalent (or the replacement
    unit of competency if and when applicable);
- an Australian Qualification Framework compliant Statement of Attainment in the
    Resources and Infrastructure Industry Training Package Unit of Competency
    RIICOM201E – Communicate in the workplace, or equivalent (or the replacement unit
    of competency if and when applicable);
- current or previous evidence of holding a valid driver’s licence^19 ;
- evidence of been issued with a valid WorkSafe WA Construction Induction Training
    card.

Basic Worksite Traffic Management accreditation is also required where Traffic Controllers are
responsible for installing and maintaining associated signing and devices, e.g. temporary
speed limit signs, ‘Prepare to Stop’ signs, etc.

Where the above Statement of Attainment is obtained outside of Western Australia, applicants
may be requested to undertake further training and assessment in the performance criteria
specific to the laws, regulations and Codes of Practice that apply in Western Australia.

Accredited Traffic Controllers at roadwork sites in Western Australia must operate in
compliance with the AGTTM Part 7: Traffic Controllers.

(^19) The need to hold or have held a drivers’ licence is to ensure an understanding of vehicle dynamics.
Exemptions may be offered under certain circumstances.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 88

### 8.3 BASIC WORKSITE TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT ACCREDITATION

A Main Roads accreditation certificate in Basic Worksite Traffic Management will be issued to
those meeting the following pre-requisites:

- an Australian Qualifications Framework compliant Statement of Attainment in the
    Resources and Infrastructure Industry Training Package Unit of Competency
    RIIWHS302E – Implement traffic management plan, or equivalent (or the replacement
    unit of competency if and when applicable);
- an Australian Qualification Framework compliant Statement of Attainment in the
    Resources and Infrastructure Industry Training Package Unit of Competency
    RIICOM201E – Communicate in the workplace, or equivalent (or the replacement unit
    of competency if and when applicable);
- evidence of been issued with a valid WorkSafe WA Construction Induction Training
    card.

Where the Statement of Attainment is obtained outside of Western Australia, applicants may
be requested to undertake further training and assessment in the performance criteria specific
to the laws, regulations and Codes of Practice that apply in Western Australia.

Where traffic devices are used, all work sites must have at least one person with Basic
Worksite Traffic Management accreditation on-site at all times when road workers are present.

Road workers with at least 12 months experience working on roads are permitted to
implement signs under direct supervision of someone that holds a BWTM accreditation. This is
only permitted on local roads with a permanent speed limit of 5 0 km/h or less and less than
15 ,000 vehicles per day.

#### 8.3.1 Basic Worksite Traffic Management - Non - Practitioner

People that do not directly undertake TTM roles at worksites, such as parking inspectors,
surveillance officers, grader operators, verge mowers, etc., but have previously gained BWTM
accreditation may find it difficult to provide evidence of active industry engagement when
applying for re-accreditation. In these cases, rather than re-sitting the full BWTM course they
may sit the refresher course and gain BWTM non-practitioner accreditation. This will allow
them to implement signs and devices associated with short term low impact works, see
AGTTM Part 5, that form part of a TMP.


MAIN ROADS Western Australia Page 89

### 8.4 WORKSITE TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT ACCREDITATION

A Main Roads accreditation certificate in Worksite Traffic Management will be issued to those
meeting the following pre-requisites:

- an Australian Qualifications Framework compliant Statement of Attainment in the
    Resources and Infrastructure Industry Training Package Unit of Competency
    RIIRIS402E – Carry out the risk management process, or equivalent (or the
    replacement unit of competency if and when applicable), and;
- a current certificate of accreditation in Basic Worksite Traffic Management, and;
- evidence of been issued with a valid WorkSafe WA Construction Induction Training
    card, and;
- attendance of the 4 - day course in Advanced Worksite Traffic Management – including
    national units RIICWD503E - Prepare workzone traffic management plan and
    RIIRIS402E - Carry out the risk management process.

NOTES:

(1)Metropolitan Functional Road Hierarchy Definitions

Primary Distributors: These provide for major regional and inter-regional traffic movement and
carry large volumes of generally fast moving traffic. Some are strategic
freight routes and all are National or State roads. They are managed by
Main Roads.

District Distributor A: These carry traffic between industrial, commercial and residential areas
and generally connect to Primary Distributors. These are likely to be
truck routes and provide only limited access to adjoining property. They
are managed by local government.

District Distributor B: Perform a similar function to type A District Distributors but with reduced
capacity due to flow restrictions caused by access to and roadside
parking alongside adjoining property. These are often older roads with a
traffic demand in excess of that originally intended. District Distributor A

and B roads run between land-use cells and generally not through them,
forming a grid which would ideally space them around 1.5km apart. They
are managed by local government.
```
Local Distributors: Carry traffic within a cell and link District Distributors at the boundary to
access roads. The route of the Local Distributor discourages through
traffic so that the cell formed by the grid of District Distributors only
carries traffic belonging to or serving the area. These roads should
accommodate buses but discourage trucks. They are managed by local
government.

Access Roads: Provides access to abutting properties with amenity, safety and aesthetic
aspects having priority over the vehicle movement function. These roads
are bicycle and pedestrian friendly. They are managed by local
government.

The decision about which functional type should be designated to each road can only be made by
the Authority responsible for managing that road.

APPENDIX 2 **–** Traffic Risk Classification

In order to clearly understand the risks associated with the works and then outline the
manner in which identified risks will be managed, the TMP designer needs to undertake
an assessment of all significant foreseeable risks associated with the works and
determine the treatment measures that, so far as is reasonably practicable, minimise the
risk.

The identification and assessment process is to be undertaken in accordance with
AS/NZS ISO 31000 and the likelihood and consequences rated before the application of
risk treatments (primary risk) and after (residual risk) the determined controls utilising
Table A2-1, Table A2-2, Table A2-3, and Table A2-4 below.

The TMP designer is to, so far as is reasonably practicable, control or reduce identified
risks in accordance with the hierarchy of control. Treatment measures are to be in
accordance with the below Table A2- 5 Management Approach for Residual Risk Rating.

A Residual Risk Rating of Very High is not permissible.

TABLE A2- 1 **–** QUALITATIVE MEASURES OF CONSEQUENCE OR IMPACT

```
Consequence Description

##### TABLE A2- 3 – QUALITATIVE MEASURES OF LIKELIHOOD

```
Likelihood Description
```
```
Rare
```
```
The event or hazard:
may occur only in exceptional circumstances,
will probably occur with a frequency of less than 0.02 times per year (i.e.
less than once in 50 years).
```
```
Unlikely
```
```
The event or hazard:
could occur at some time,
will probably occur with a frequency of 0.02 to 0.1 times per year (i.e.
once in 10 to 50 years).
```
```
Possible
```
```
The event or hazard:
might occur at some time,
will probably occur with a frequency of 0.1 to 1 times per year (i.e. once
in 1 to 10 years).
```
```
Likely
```
```
The event or hazard:
will probably occur in most circumstances,
will probably occur with a frequency of between 1 and 10 times per year.
```
```
Almost
certain
```
```
The event or hazard:
is expected to occur in most circumstances,
will probably occur with a frequency in excess of 10 times per year.
```
IMPORTANT NOTE: The likelihood of an event or hazard occurring must first be
assessed over the duration of the activity (i.e. “period of exposure”). For risk
assessment purposes the assessed likelihood must then be proportioned for a “period of
exposure” of one year.

Example: An activity has a duration of 6 weeks (i.e. “period of exposure” = 6 weeks).
The event or hazard being considered is assessed as likely to occur once every 20 times
the activity occurs (i.e. likelihood or frequency = 1 event/20 times activity occurs = 0.05
times per activity). Assessed annual likelihood or frequency = 0.05 times per activity x
52 weeks/6 weeks = 0.4 times per year. Assessed likelihood = Possible.
